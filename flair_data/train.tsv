__label__DontSave	Comments of Wolak Wolak makes some good points.  In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing.  I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJMs implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we dont want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enrons promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices.  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

Vince   -----Original Message----- From:  Frank A. Wolak <wolak@zia.Stanford.EDU>@ENRON   Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 4:28 PM To: Kaminski, Vince J Subject:    Vince,    Ive been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM. I just wanted to warn you that Im not sure this is in Enrons long-term interest at all.  Let me explain why.  Feel free to give me a call if youd like to talk more about this.    First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides.  The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.    However, bear in mind FERCs desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices.    In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.    As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

Sendout model - We would like to help them better optimize their morning  sendout taking into account current market pricing and the Enron supply deal.  PBR - We are not sure when or if  Peoples will file a PBR, but I think that  there are a lot of things that we learned during our previous experience that  we can do to help them prepare for a competitive marketplace (ie transport  customers tariff restructuring)  PESC - Peoples is looking for assistance in understanding load following and  helping them build models to optimize their retail gas effort  San Juan pricing - Evan has been working with the Desk to provide indicative  pricing with regard to PEC hedging out some of their San Juan production  reserves  Power  Power project development - we have several power projects underway and the  CTG group (Billy Lemmons) is helping us create necessary models   PESC - the retail power stuff lives.  Ive think that Fallon has a new  attitude on these deals and Enron has committed to help them figure out this  market.  Power plant balancing model - we have in our portfolio and will be offering  balancing/storage services for Chicago area power projects.  We would like to  have a model or at least a better understanding to help us with this endeavor.   We have resources in Chicago dedicated to these projects, as well as the  other stuff were trying to do like negotiate contracts and set up the  Chicago back office function.

Loss of demand due to economic weakness is exacerbated by the impact of the tragedy of September 11. Lower prices have already slowed drilling activity. Although ample storage levels will guard against last years peaks, gas prices will likely to continue to oscillate in the near term.  * The US gas supply rebound expected after record drilling rates is now unlikely. CERA expects only modest production increases for 2001 and a year- over-year decline for 2002.  * CERA has analyzed two paths for demand recovery depending on the severity and length of the economic downturn. Generally, the large overbuild of gas-fired generating plants and the recovery of industrial demand should cause much of the lost demand to return in 2002.   **end**  Follow above URL for complete CERA Watch (38 printed pages).

I sorted out 12 forward curves from an original forward vol curve, each of 12  curves corresponding to certain month. Then I fitted each of 12 curves with a function:  y=a+A/power(x+b, beta)  I figured out that when beta is from (0, .5) the above function is suitable  for performing our bootstrapping routine of deriving ff vols from implied, because:  y(x+t) * y(x+t) * (x+t) - y(x) * y(x) * tx> 0                  for all x, t.

__label__DontSave	EOL Pricing Algorithm Update Hi  Ive attached a couple of files summarizing our progress and current status on modeling the bid-ask spread.  The first summarizes characterization of the EOL Crude data and the second describes a bid-ask spread model based on options theory developed by Zimin (The figure from the paper is included separately).  I am now setting up an Excel spreadsheet to test this model with the EOL data.  Let me know when you would like to meet to review this.

__label__Save	Impending Visit July 5-7 Vince:  I plan to be in Houston on July 5-7.  I would like very much to get together with you and perhaps your investment guy on Friday morning on the 7th if you and/or he have the time or perhaps on the 5th in the afternoon.  I would like to continue the discussions about your using MarketPoint and about your investment guy considering MarketPoint if he is interested.  When you see the progress we have made, I think you will agree that it merits consideration as a part of enrononline.com as well as a profitable investment in its own right.  It is still in the situation where it can be provided exclusively to whomever I choose; I have been very, very careful how I have promoted it so that I do not get committed to a second-rate partner.  I also have what I think is a fundamentally new, general Markovian forward optionality evaluator.  I wrote my Ph.D. dissertation at Stanford in the 1970s (defended with honors) in semi-Markovian decision processes during the heyday of that research, and I have seen direct applications in optionality evaluation.  I think you will be fascinated to see and review it. It is presently implemented in prototype form and it could be made available to the first large retainer client on an exclusive basis who is sufficiently interested.  If you want to be that retainer client, that would be of interest to me.  Give me a shout via return email or by my cell phone at 650.218.3069 regarding schedule.  I am out of town this week but available via email or phone at the above addresses.  I really hope we can get together that week if we possibly can.  Thanks very much for considering my request, and thanks very much for being the go between with your investment guy.  I deeply appreciate it.  I hope to see you on the 5th or 7th.

__label__DontSave	Thoughts for re-org Vince and Stinson,  I have some thoughts on the re-org for the group.   As far as the valuation as concerned,  I think we should not divide ourselves  by commodity.  Simulating power prices is not too much different from simulating  gas  prices, and so is the options pricing.  Actually there is some synergy to  share some common techniques that are specific to each market.    So I propose that Stinson runs a bigger valuation group that  includes the power-related deals pricing.   In terms of personnel, Alex, Tom, and Lance could be a valuable addition to the valuation term.  Let me know if my thoughts are too far off.

__label__Save	Re: working gas price model Vince-  I have a simplified version of Brads model in mind.  The no arbitrage condition equates trading margins across the country.  Costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network. Wellhead supply is  almost completely price- elastic, while burner-tip demand is almost  completely price inelastic. Storage is rationalized as a perpetual call  option.  The least time-variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing  gas from storage to the pipeline, followed by the costs of delivering gas  from the wellhead to the pipeline. The intermediate-variant parameters are  the capacity-dependent costs paid to the pipeline (above shrinkage) for  transmission. The most time-variant parameters are the trading margins and  the valuations of the storage option.  There are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork.  They are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways: using a short  time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability  mentioned above, or point-estimates (calibrations) using only todays data  based on a node-based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with  the same region of origination, albeit markedly different terminus, price  versus capacity similarly, competing for outflows.  I will write this up for you in Scientific Word and present it to you at your  earliest convenience.

Imagine the opportunity!  Imagine that the leading energy company in the world has picked you to run  the  company that it expects to be the leading retail energy company in North  America.  So you get a sharp competitive edge in the back room, you recruit IBM as a  co-owner assuring you the lowest cost per customer by a factor of two or  three.  To get your foot in 27 million doors you recruit AOL as a co-venturer with a  commitment from AOL to promote NewPowers wares.  You do an IPO and take in  about $700 million for working capital.  The IPO is over and the quiet period  it required.  But the most important silver spoon -- so that you get your  energy at the best price and to protect you against price spikes -- you get  up front 30 Enron-trained   risk managers and traders.  Can you imagine  having to recruit them?  To make sure this team is run by the optimum chief they picked Eugene  Lockhart,  most recently president of Consumer Services at AT&T and before  that president of BankAmericas Global Retail Bank with its consumer,  commercial and small business banking services delivered through 3,000+  branches.  Now, Lockharts talking about his plans.  Restructuring Today had lunch with Lockhart Thursday and reported in detail  (to read the full story see attachment):  ?   How NewPower intends to actually start up the retail industry?  What is  the heart of NewPowers business plan? ?   How theyll make money in markets where margins may seem too thin. ?   How hes going to have 600,000+ customers next month and easily a million  by the end of 2001. ?   What percentage of their sales come from the NewPower website.  What  figure is he using for cost of customer acquisition? ?   Lockhart plans to have by the end of the first quarter or at the latest  the second quarter 750,000 customers making them by far the largest  unregulated retail  marketer in the US. ?   How does he think utilities will compete with the NewPower paradigm? ?   What marketshare do they expect to get at first and then by 2005? ?   What does he see as his biggest challenge? ?   Why is this a good time for NewPower to invade California markets? ?   Why will NewPower succeed where Enron failed? ?   Whats the role of backward dating in forward market margins? ?   Where NewPower gives a 20-25% discount on the commodity portion of a  bill, what kind of margin can it make now? ?   How do higher prices help NewPower?  Were actually in a very good  position given (that) the gas cost increases perversely will work in our  favor ...  ?   We have a 10-year, exclusive agreement with IBM whereby we can issue a  bill, collect the money and care for a customer at lower cost than anyone  else in the industry by several orders of magnitude.

In this way, you would have complete physical and administrative custody over the data and any work you do with it. I neednt be involved, and you can know your work is completely confidential.  Ill make SAS and the EOL software available, as well as the necessary RAM the server, at no charge. You just need to summon up some SysAdmin resources to finish the job.

__label__Save	Ethylene margin collar simulation model I set up the simulation model.  The margin follows a mean-reverting process.  I seperarted the data into two category, margin >0.04  and margin <0.04. Then I estimate the mean reverting speed seperately for these two data sets. I got higher mean reverting speed than that I estimated using the whole data  set.  The high MR speed surpresses the probability at high payout side. Since the MR speed is sensitive to where I divide the data, so Bob will run  a few senarios.  I put the overal settlement cap and floor into the montly premium  calculation, so the the result in E18 on the summary page is the ultimate answer to the deal  pricing. I also calculate the undiscounted payout distribution and overall collar  worth.  Relax the overall cap and floor will have a direct comparison with the spread  option approach that Bob and Lee set up.    Look like we got a reasonable model.    Stinson: Id like to have you check my set up for the simulation model.  Lee and Douglas: You can play with the model, and let me know what do you think.

__label__Save	JCC Good morning.  I apologize for the response delay.  Ive gone back through  the analysis that I did back in April, and have thrown around some ideas with  Vince and Stinson.  The issue may be summarized as follows.   The hedge relationship was derived using JCC and prompt Brent, and is valid  for JCC and prompt Brent.  No problems here.  However, it will not be valid  for points far out on the forward curve.  Intuitively, this hedge  relationship will approach one as we move far out on the curve, but since  there is no data, I can not statistically determine this.  One can imagine a  term structure of heding ratios that start at 0.67 and move to 1.0, so that  the back end of the curves would move together, but how fast it converges to  one is anyones guess.   If there is a way of determining the historical JCC forward curve, then the  hedge relationships may be estimated.  However, I have been unable to  determine a rigorous approach to building the JCC curve.     I can explain this far better in person, and would like to talk as soon as  possible at your convenience.   -Kevin Kindall Kevin Kindall kevin.kindall@enron.com enron.com Marc De La Roche marc.roche@enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com  Stinson Gibner stinson.gibner@enron.com

Rather, it allows the situation in California to  continue to develop virtually unabated.  The political strategy appears to  allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape  shouldering the blame.  Once they are politically inoculated,  the  Administration can begin to look at regional solutions.  Moreover, the  Administration has already made explicit (and will certainly restate in the  forthcoming Cheney commission report) its opposition to stronger price caps  on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the  construction of new generation.  It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were  generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who  favors price caps actually voted against this plan.   2. Something Less than Effective Price Caps  From Daviss point of view, the FERC plan has four major flaws: ? The order applies only to California, not to the rest of the west.  Non-California generators are not required to sell at capped rates to  California. ? As the order is written, it is more of a price floor for emergency power  than a ceiling. ? State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game  the system, because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage 2  emergency and does not require any collusion. ? Even when the price caps kick in, they are based on the cost-plus for the  highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require  wholesalers to abide by the cap.  The generators can also charge above the  cap, provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC.  3. Proposal Kill Clause Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be  withdrawn unless Californias ISO agrees by June 1st to become part of the  regional grid now under FERC control.  If Davis doesnt sign on to the  regional grid by June 1st, then he will have to live with June 2nd headlines  blaming him for letting the Bush price caps plan collapse.  4. Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California  could therefore pay as much as $20 billion  on power this summer - this is more  than the combined enterprise value of  PG&E and SCE.  These sources believe that, because of the severity of the  situation, the FERC and/or the  federal government will be forced to take  further action to control prices for  power.  The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about  90 days. One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to  finance new power plant construction in exchange for long-term power deals.   The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge  loans they are providing to California.  The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness  of the fiscal picture.  The countrys largest and most prosperous state will  have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating  deficits in a matter of months.  5. QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PG&E Meanwhile, on the bankruptcy front, the QFs reportedly  will ask the  bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGEs  accounts,  since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment  for  gas. It appears very unlikely that the QFs request will be granted. If the   QFs do not receive advance payment, it is likely that most of the 4,000 mw   of gas-fired QF capacity will remain offline.   6 Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for long-term contracts are  being  continually renegotiated, which is likely to mean that the new plants  those  contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as  anticipated.  7. Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey  Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an  analysis  of the MOU for the SCE bailout  plan.  The analysis was done by a   utilities analyst, rather than a lawyer, though it appears to raise a number  of  good legal points. For example, one of the elements of the MOU is a  non-bypassable charge  on ratepayers that would require  them to pay even  if they disconnect from the grid. This is effectively a tax,  since there is  no exchange of value  for money, which under the CA constitution cannot be  used to directly  benefit a private entity.  This makes  the bonds that would  be issued are general obligation bonds, rather than revenue  bonds. According  to the constitution, the state cannot be put into debt to  benefit a private  company.  For this and other reasons, even if the  Republicans would vote for  the SCE bailout, which remains  unlikely, the bailout probably would not   stand a likely constitutional challenge.    8. Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose Long-Term Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to  disclose the details of the long-term  power  contracts continues to  distress the other players in the  crisis.   Even if he were to  disclose everything he and his staff have been  negotiating, it is likely that their actions and negotiations will  challenged, creating an even further delay.

I left a voice message on this conference subject with you.  We want to invite you to speak at our conference.  Thought you might like to take a look at the preliminary agenda so I am attaching that to this email.  This is the fourth year of our conference.  It has grown in quality and attendance each year.  The conference is held at Skamania lodge, which is about 45 minutes from the Portland airport.  Basically, we expect an attendance of about 70-80 individuals from the US and Canada.  We get a broad spectrum of attendance both geographically and functionally.  It is an excellent opportunity for networking and building knowledge about electric markets.  All of the presentations are very well attended.  We strive also for a broad spectrum of high quality speakers.  Many have no relation with EPIS, we simply are looking for the best speakers we can find.  We have a high respect for you and know that you would greatly add to the value of our conference.  It has always been a pleasure to work with you in the past.  For this conference, we would consult with you to develop a speaking topic that would fit with your desires and with our program.  As a speaker, your conference fees would be handled by us.  And the conference fees include all meals except one dinner.  You would handle the travel and hotel.  We also provide some opportunity for relaxation with a catered reception/dinner at the Columbia Gorge Interpretive Center, which overlooks the gorge and is filled with great history and information about the spectacular gorge, and on the second evening an informal/fun golf tournament (included in the conference fees) for those who are interested.  We hope that you would give this your consideration, and we look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks  Warren   Warren H.

Parks; Anthony Beebe; Chris Jensen;  Arthur Jiantao Yan Subject:  Rice Energy Club Roundtable topics Dear John, dear  Vincent,   Let me up-date  you on the roundtables we decided in the last meeting to focus on during the  rest of the academic year.  The  original idea was to keep the number of events from 3 to 4 roundtables each  semester.  The result of the last  meeting with all members was driven by enthusiasm, and as you see below we  produced a prolific list of 13 subjects.   Maybe you can help us to narrow down to a reasonable number, 12 events  (one we had yesterday) by May 2002 we think are too many.    I also would take  this opportunity to update on the ongoing relationships with the most  prominent industry in the sectors and have your feedback, suggestion on how to  group them in the roundtable. We got great  support so far from Reliant, Enron, Mirant, Schell (Coral), Bp, Duke.   El Paso, Chevron-Texaco,  Phillips, and Halliburton etc.. also are interested and we will present the  club to them as well.  The major  challenge for us is not transform the Energy Club in a Finance Energy  Club.  At Rice we already have a  Finance club and it works very well.   We want first educate about the energy industry in general, and second  present the opportunities for MBAs in the industry in different areas,  including finance but not limited to.   Topics  of Roundtable Meetings:   0)  Energy 101  1)  Corporate Finance (Treasurer or Controller) 2)  Energy Consulting 3)  Financial Services (trading, risk management) 4)  Origination, Marketing and Sales (Oil, Gas, Electricity) -  Marteen 5)  Project Development, strategic planning 6)  Project Finance 7)  Project Risk Management 8)  Regulation, Deregulation, and Restructuring - Reliant done  9/17/2001 9)  Structuring of Products 10)  Supply Chain 11)  Telecom - Broadband 12)  Venture Capital within energy industry - Brian, Paresh   Thanks  in advance for your precious suggestions and I am looking forward to meeting  you.

I can see some excellent collection opportunities for our group as a result  of your presentation and look forward to discussing them with you on my  return.  We think we can get excellent info on production & exports in  Russia, as well as good insight into anti-dumping out of DC and the WTO.

__label__Save	RE: EOL Pricing Algorithm Hi Bob,  some comments : 1.  You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after  limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.   I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the  trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and  offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this  target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and  without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron  position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights. 2.  You request bid-mid-ask prices for each trade --- given that a successful  trade may execute later than time of order (especially for limit orders),  would you need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over this time interval  (time of order to time of execution)?  Also, for failed trades, you may need  the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over the time interval from time of  order to time of rejection.  This again mainly applies to limit orders, as  the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed  of execution (something to check).   -----Original Message----- From:  Lee, Bob   Sent: Monday, April 23, 2001 8:33 AM To: Kaminski, Vince; Shanbhogue, Vasant; Barkley, Tom Cc: Lu, Zimin; Huang, Alex; Gibner, Stinson Subject: EOL Pricing Algorithm  A draft data request for EOL data we would use to study P&L patterns for the  George pricing algorithm is attached for your review.

Gas prices briefly fell below $2.00 per MMBtu in October. From a midsummer peak of 1,068 gas-directed rigs, the US industry active rig count plummeted to 834 by November 9 and could fall as low as 700-750. Producers drilling plans for the 2002 budget year are already being curtailed.  *  The drilling downturn could mean as many as 8,000 fewer gas wells in the United States over the next 12 months and 1.5 to 2.0 billion cubic feet per day of lost production.  *  The majority of the activity reduction is onshore, but the significant drop in Gulf of Mexico shallow shelf drilling will have a huge impact on productive capacity.  *  Gas supply could be extremely tight once again next year just as the economy recovers, and gas demand is expected to rebound with it.  **end**  Follow above URL for complete report.

The column was written by James Kobielus, who talked about authenticating digital signatures.  Reader John R. agrees with assumption in the column, saying that for these signatures attached at the bottom of the message to carry any weight, they need to be validated. To prove his point, he attached a signature to his message. To the naked eye, one would think its OK. But, the signature was one he pulled off an old CERT alert. Obviously, I dont check digital signatures that vigorously.  John writes there are a couple other common foibles in dealing with e-mail signatures:  * Assumption that if the from: ID is of a friend, it must have been consciously sent by that person.  Besides outright SMTP forgery (fakemail via port 25), it is possible that another person is using the friends system and sent the e-mail, or that a software routine hooked into the friends e-mail account. The latter has been the [modus operandi] of some recent worms and Trojans, John writes.   * Failure to understand the difference between the userID and the domain portions of an e-mail address.  In one type of Web scam, a [perpetrator] gets, say, a Hotmail or Juno account with a user ID that looks a lot like a trusted company name. Naive people receive the email and think it is from a trusted company. For example, a scam artist getting a Network_World@hotmail.com address and passing himself off as a Network World representative, he writes. Loosely related to the e-mail insecurities are some Web link tricks, but this is for another time.  Thanks for the e-mail John. Maybe well have to start signing our e-mails. You can read the Kobielus column at: http://www.nwfusion.com/columnists/2000/1127kobielus.html   Todays bug patches and security alerts:   DoS bug in Cisco Catalyst switches  A bug exists in Cisco Catalyst switches that could allow a user to launch a denial-of-service attack. If repeated, failed telnet requests are made to the switch, the device could fail to accept traffic and commands until rebooted. For more information: http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/catalyst-memleak-pub.shtml   Cisco fixes multiple vulnerabilities in CBOS  Cisco last week announced that it had fixed a number of holes in CBOS, the operating system for its 600-series family of routers. The problems range from possible SYN flood denial-of- service vulnerabilities to a locking problem when a specific URL is sent to the router. For more information: http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/CBOS-multiple.shtml   Microsoft releases tool for SNMP Parameters vulnerability  A bug in the way Windows 2000 handles some SNMP parameters could allow a user in a network group to monitor or change network service maliciously. This tool fixes the problem in the registry key. For more information: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-096.asp  A similar vulnerability affects Windows NT 4.0 as well as Version 4.0s RAS Administration Key and MTS Package Administration key. Windows NT 4.0 users can find more information and patches at: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-095.asp   Local root compromise in Lexmark MarkVision  The Lexmark MarkVision printer management utility for Unix contains an overflow that could allow a user to gain root access on the affected system. By exploiting the vulnerability, the user could execute code as root. For fixes: ftp://ftp.lexmark.com/pub/driver/unix/MarkVision/V4.4   New BitchX patches fix DoS vulnerability  The popular Linux IRC client BitchX contains two vulnerabilities. First, a stack overflow exists in the client that can be exploited if a malformed Domain Name System (DNS) answer is processed. A second vulnerability allows the malformed packets to be hidden by valid DNS packets. For more information on BitchX: http://www.bitchx.org/   Remote command vulnerability in phpGroupWare  According to an alert from Secure Reality, phpGroupWare makes insecure calls to the include () function of PHP which can allow the inclusion of remote files, and thereby the execution of arbitrary commands on the remote web server with the permissions of the Web server user, usually nobody. PhpGroupWare is a groupware program that combines calendar, e- mail, file sharing and to do lists into one application. For a patch: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7305   Conectiva releases fixed version of Bash  The Bash module for Linux contains vulnerability in its creation of temporary files. The files are written in a predictable manner and can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite files on the affected system.

__label__Save	Interview - Credit Derivatives Dear  Vince:           Thank you for  the invitation yesterday. It was a pleasure to meet you all and learn more about  the group, its structure and to some extent what you are involved in. Please  extend my thanks to all of them.           I am  particularly interested in the Credit Swap trading platform that Enron has  recently started. Such a platform will provide unique visibility into the Credit  markets. As you suggested I tried to learn more about this from Tanya. I  would like to learn more and if possible meet other people more directly linked  to the effort.           Just simple  instruments like Credit Swaps will require serious modelling capability for the  pricing and the hedging of these apparently simple intruments. The market  visibility I mention above can be explored through Credit Derivatives Trading  successfully if Enron possesses superior (vis a vis Morgan Stanley, Salomon  Smith Barney, Chase Manhatan, etc.) modelling technology in Credit  Derivatives. I can and would like to consider the possibility of doing this  for Enron. I would like to help develop and participate in putting together that  business.           As I  mentioned to you I have done some work in Credit Derivatives and am deeply  familiar with virtually all the work of the principal academics in Credit  Derivatives namely: Duffie, Lando, Tuffano, Duffee, Das, Lelland, etc. I have  read carefully most of their work (published as well as working papers) on the  subject to date.           I look  forward to hearing from you.

The reason for contacting you today is to let you know I will be in Houston  next week between Monday and Wednesday inclusive.  If there is an opportunity to  meet up, probably informally, it would be useful to discuss our continuing  activities in the areas of Strategy, Value and, increasingly, Real Options.  If you are attending our Energy Symposium, or can meet up, please contact me  at your convenience.  If we do meet, I would also like to introduce you to one of our senior managers from Houston:  George E. Danner.  George is a member of  our US National Strategy team and part of our global network of specialists  working on real option pricing.  If I do not speak to you before tomorrow - happy Thanksgiving.

I will ring Mike tonight, i.e.  Houston tomorrow morning.   ....had a look at the temps and anomalies over CA, looks warm for this time  of the year (Dec.), there has been an increase in the night time  T_min, and T_max remains at an above average level.

__label__DontSave	HDAF seminar topics Folks:  I am trying to set up a meeting with professor Don Kouri of the University of  Houston and I believe you may have an interest in the topic of discussion.   If you know of other interested parties, or want to substitute a proxy for  yourselves, please let me know.  This first meeting with Dr. Kouri will introduce the participants to his area  of research (HDAFs for data analysis) and allow us to define the contents and  attendants of a seminar (to come up soon).  We are looking to hold this discussion this week (hopefully) and to have the  seminar happen before Christmas (given that this is the in-between semester  season for schools).  A couple of other similar meetings will follow up: Dr Kevin Bassler  will be  talking about Microscopic Simulation of Economic Markets and Dr. Pinsky about  the Effect of Solar phenomena on the Earths atmosphere.

For possible topics to be discussed at a small ``roundtable format meeting, here are some possibilities. 1. HDAFs for data analysis, including ``gap-filling, data extrapolation, denoising, mathematical manipulations of digital data (e.g., taking derivatives, applying functions of differential operators to digital data, etc.)  2. HDAFs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear partial differential equations, particularly for equations for which existing methods encounter stability problems.  There are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the HDAFs but I think that even trying to do both of the above in a single meeting would be difficult. Of course, in this first meeting we would focus on general aspects of the HDAFs that make them robust for such applications. If, however, you have other topics in which you are interested, I am willing to focus on them.  Regarding timing of a meeting, I am free from teaching duties now so I am flexible. I will be in Houston all of December. I look forward to hearing more from you.

__label__Save	London Research Group John,  I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.  As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research  Group, is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of  talent we have currently in London. Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  its time to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.   My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader,  highly respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy  level and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.  His promotion is likely to cause Anjams departure form Enron. I value  technical skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, dont think he is the  same caliber as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to  Houston for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a  sufficient incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has  greatly improved.  Please, let me know what you think.

__label__Save	Valuation Methodology Weve had a request from AA to provide them with some sort of write-up or documentation from our research group on the valuation methodology used on the contingent issuance instrument for 18 million shares that was a part of the Raptor transaction completed at the end of March.  Apparently, this request has come from AAs expert in this area (I believe that his name is Dechundra, or something like that.  Ive probably destroyed the spelling on that.  You guys are probably very familiar with him.)  Anyway, is there such documentation that we can provide them easily?  If so, let me know so that we can try to get AA finished with their review of the transaction.  In talking to our contacts at AA, I believe that their expert will be wanting to talk to you after he reviews the methodology documentation.

My question now concerns the copyrights. Since the version you sent is  slightly different, do you think this gives us the freedom to publish it  without the consent of Risk?  And if not - can you tell me if it was published by Risk UK or Risk in the  States? And which issue was it? I just want to have all of the details if I  need to call someone at the magazine ...

Maybe it is from his consulting background, I found that at times he exaggerates a bit about his roles in model building. He would  start saying he did everything, and later water it down quite a bit. (What he actually did is not an easy accomplishment though.)  He also stressed that he wants to move away from pipeline  projects.  I did not got a chance to ask him any questions about derivatives and finance.

__label__Save	SDDP Model John, Attached is a copy of the SDDP Methodology manual, written by the  developers.  The model was developed by Mario Pereira, who is the proprietor  of PSRI (Power Systems Research Inc) in Rio de Janeiro.   Their web site is:  www.psr-inc.com where you can find more information about the company and  contact details.  Mario and most of the staff speak English, so phone calls  are possible.    Development of SDDP was originally done on a World Bank contract to compare  the benefits of new generation and transmission system interconnections in  Central America.  It has since found much wider application.  The code runs  on a PC, and is licensed to a number of consultants, power companies, etc.   While I was with ECNZ in Wellington, New Zealand, we purchased a copy around  1994.  The model works with weekly or monthly time steps, with a time horizon of  from 1 to 10 years, for mid to long range planning of hydro thermal power  systems.  It represents loads in each period as from one to five load blocks,  so it is not a chronological model.  This type of model can not handle  thermal plant ramp rates and similar chronological system constraints.  Im  not sure how important that would be to you.  The optimization phase of the  model takes into account hydrological uncertainty using a form of stochastic  dynamic programming with sampling.  This phase sets up a function for water  value in each large reservoir in the system.  The simulation phase uses a  number of hydrological outcomes to collect statistics on how the system would  operate.  The water values can be used with the short term optimization mode  of SDDP or in some other more detailed short term optimization model.  Most constraints found in hydro systems can be modelled.  Many transmission  constraints can be modelled.  A DC load flow option can be used to determine  bus nodal prices.  A Visual Basic user interface is provided which reads and writes text files.  If youd like to know more about SDDP, you could call me here in Houston.

I work for Aspen Technology Inc. www.aspentech.com We have not met, but a colleague of mine forwarded a copy of your presentation on Price Dynamics in the Energy Markets from the SIAM conference last April and am writing to you to encourage you to consider making a presentation at Aspens corporate world conference Aspen World 2002 in October in Washington DC on this topic as well as the broader topic of Risk assessment and management in the energy markets. I know this seems a little strange making a cold-call in this manner, but I am reaching out in the community of Risk and Uncertainty management in the Supply Chain, Process and Energy markets to identify and solicit compelling speakers. AspenTech does not have a traditionally strong or well developed business or application layer in this realm, but, as our enterprise-wide reach and activities in planning, forecasting and supply chain have grown and integrated, I and the technology drivers in the company have been cultivating a demand and recognition for risk management and pricing activities to BE the next logical dimension to our growth and technology. Therefore, the session I am chairing (see the abstract below) will be one intended to educate, entice, and compel our clientele, business partners and staff on the business value, technology and mathematical and modeling technique. I would be happy to elaborate on the intended audience and opportunity for the conference. Please contact me at your earliest convenience by email or phone at the numbers below to discuss things if you think it would be a possibility or, if you would like more information on the context of the work and subject matter in AspenTechs core businesses.  Thanks in advance for your time.  Sincerely, Skip Paules  Uncertainty and Risk Management in Supply Chain and Process Modeling  This session will examine the assessment and quantification of uncertainties and risk in the supply chain and process modeling arena. The emphasis is on the modeling and enterprise business process aspects. Topics should include: point solution methods, such as design and real-time optimization application at the process level; planning and scheduling applications; as well as enterprise level solution strategies that balance forecasting, supply chain, planning, scheduling and operations. Commodities trading models, strategies and techniques are also included in this scope. What developments in the applications and theory of the field will allow us to take collections of deterministic modeling tools to the next strategic level where objectives for capital projects, operations, and supply chain optimization models incorporate not only economics, but also value-at-risk and/or robustness elements to create more broadly applicable or hedged strategies to achieve the desired goals.  Possible presentation topics will include:  *   Uncertain supply, demand in planning and scheduling *   Robust plant-wide optimization (real-time) *   Robust control *   Value-at-risk (VAR) quantification in modeling applications *   Dynamic hedging in commodities trading (e.g. energy markets) *   Flexible design and synthesis *   Model sensitivies to uncertain parameters or demand *   General algorithmic and modeling strategies for incorporating Risk, Sensitivity, and/or Uncertainty  _________________________________________ Granville (Skip) E.

__label__DontSave	RE: Pricing of restriction on Enron stock Vince, I just spoke with Rakesh.  I believe that there is some confusion regarding which part of that Raptor transaction we are talking about.  There are actually two different sets of forwards: one for up to 18MM shares contingently based on price as an offset to the Whitewing forward shortfall, and the other was for 12MM shares which was more of a straight restricted forward contract on ENE shares.  We all went over the valuations on both sets of forwards pretty thoroughly back in March, and Im certain that the valuations that were put together included the contingent nature of the forwards on the 18MM shares.  In fact, I believe that we had a meeting with a couple of managers from Arthur Andersen to discuss the general methodology.  Of course, the valuations on the 12MM shares had no such component.  Let me know if you have more questions or concerns.  Thanks Vince. Ron   -----Original Message----- From:  Kaminski, Vince J   Sent: Tuesday, May 22, 2001 6:00 PM To: Baker, Ron Cc: Bharati, Rakesh; Kaminski, Vince J Subject: Pricing of restriction on Enron stock  Ron,  Rakesh mentioned that there is an additional conditionality that will result in an adjustment of our valuation of the restrictions imposed on the forwards going into the Raptor vehicles.  We were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project.  We can, however, easily, incorporate it in our valuation model. This omission makes our valuation more conservative form the Enrons point of view.   Please, let us know if this is required.

__label__DontSave	Energy Executive Committee Vince,   As you have seen in the write-ups I have been sending you, we have established the Energy Markets Institute here to provide a world class recruitment, specialized training, and research resource for the energy industry.  The clear challenge now is to deliver on this as expeditiously as possible, and we need help and input from industry leaders. We have set up an Energy Executive Committee to work with us on making this a valuable resource for the industry. So far, Bruce Williamson (CEO, Duke Energy Global Markets), Gerald McElvey (Upstrean Controller, ExxonMobil), Fran Keeth (Exec. VP, Shell Oil), Donna Pedersen-McGinnis (VP, Dynegy), Bruce Sukaly (Sr. VP, Cinergy), Bob Peebler (Retired, Halliburton) have agreed to be on the committee.  The committee is being put together by Lane Sloan (Retired, Shell Oil).   Both Lane and I very much want to have your input. Enron is a leading energy firm (and from my perspective, it is the future of the industry). So we would like Enron to be represented, and I personally would be delighted and gratified to have your advice and evaluation.  We plan to organize subcommittees dealing with Education, Research, and Trading---so it may just involve two meetings a year.  We are looking at November 14 (5-7 p.m.) for the first meeting of the committee.  Please let me know if you would agree to be on the Committee.   We are now in the process of recruiting top-name in energy-finance for the Bauer chair (endowment $3 million).  I also want to discuss any suggestion you may have on people we should be trying to recruit for this.  Best wishes,  Praveen  Praveen Kumar Chair and Professor of Finance C.T.

__label__DontSave	re:- developing electricity model at Enron Dr. Kaminski:  Thanks very much for taking the time to talk with me about my electricity model when you visited Carnegie Mellon. (I was the PhD student in Finance who had a two-factor model for pricing electricity. My model incorporated strategic behaviour and varying price elasticities across different consumers of electricity). While here, you mentioned the possibility of further developing my model at Enron. One avenue you suggested was through the summer internship program at Enron. If this is still an option, I would very much like to talk with you or one of your associates about working with or at Enron on my model.  I can be reached by phone at (412) 683-9085.

__label__DontSave	Briefing Ken Lay Vince,   I would like to respond to the discussion that we had today.  It probably would have been more accurate to characterize my work for Ken Lay as a briefing rather than as a speech.  When I said I wrote a speech, I meant I prepared presentation material for him to use for his speaking engagement.  I thought that writing a speech and preparing a presentation is OK to use interchangeably in the English language.   In my review I stated as an accomplishment,  I worked with the Chairman of Enron, Ken Lay, briefing him on President Bushs tax proposals helping him prepare for a trip to the White House along with Steve Kean.   However, I think the results are the same.  Ken Lay and Steve Kean were pleased with our contribution.  To me this was an accomplishment not only for me, but our group, and I would hope The Reseach Department.    For you to say that my misuse of the English language undermines my credibility, however, is a bit strong and I do not agree.  I pride myself in is my honesty.

__label__Save	Energy Book Hi Grant,  Hope all is well with you. I trust you got my message via the voicemail that Ileft with Vince late Friday afternoon about my inability to travel - Im trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of weeks time when my ear has cleared up, and I look forward to meeting with you one day.  I wrote to Vince last week asking for a favour, but Im not sure ifhe is there in Houston. I know that you guys are probably very busy but I was wondering if you can write a few sentences for me. Im sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively (all of them!) to my request for some feedback on the book. Chapter 1 has an overview of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter. Could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter?  Im including what I have already written (although I think it has changed slightly from this version) so that you can see the style.  Many thanks and best regards.  Chris.    2 Overview of this Book  This book aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives.  In the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets, and which underlie the rest of the book.  As well as introducing the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and Monte Carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book.  In Chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices.  Apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices. We look at the well-know process of GBM as well as mean reversion, stochastic volatility and jump processes, discussing each, and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated.  Chapter 3, written by Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson of Enron Capital and Trade .  Chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets.  Although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves.  What we do in this chapter  Chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not-so-common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses.  Examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as energy swaptions, compound options, Asian (or average rate) options, Barriers, lookbacks, and ladder options.  Chapter 6 investigates single and multi-factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives.  Closed form solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps.  Chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and American style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6.  Simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options.  In order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial tree scheme is developed.  This tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard American style options.  Chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve.  The approach results in a multi-factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form.  Closed-form solutions are developed for pricing standard European options and efficient Monte Carlo schemes for exotic options.  The chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of American style options.  Chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions. In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time.  We begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7.  The general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi-factor hedging and this is also discussed.  Chapter 10 looks at the key risk-management concept of Value at Risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios.  After discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs (volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.  We then compare the fours major methodologies for computing VaR; Delta, Delta-gamma, historical simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation.  Finally, we look at testing the VaR estimates for various underlying energy market variables.

A series of important developments in Mexicos gas market is reducing the potential for long-term domestic natural gas productive capacity.  *  Low natural gas exploration and production investment. Investment in natural gas exploration does not appear to be enough to significantly increase productive capacity in the future.  *  Low expectations of the new Pemex multiservice contracts. Though Pemex has announced a new model for service contracts and expects to have a bid round by mid-2002, CERA does not expect an enthusiastic response from the private sector.  *  New liquefied natural gas (LNG) import projects reduce the pressure for increasing domestic capacity. The strong interest in developing LNG import terminals and recent LNG regulatory progress are reducing political pressure to increase domestic capacity.  **end**  Follow above URL for complete CERA Insight (4 printed pages).

__label__DontSave	Risk Profile and Liability Mitigation Product Please find attached a Scope of Services document and a list of projects which have been implemented with current EES customers.  The Scope of Services document is designed to show the types of projects, operations and maintenance, and facilities management services that EESO typically offers to its customers based on their industry segment.  The projects and services offered are very similar across segments and customers, but their level of deployment varies significantly from segment to segment.    Certain segments were grouped together because the EESO offering would feature similar assets and services. SIC Codes were given for each segment to represent the types of customers that comprise each segment.  The list of projects represents general categories from which more specific projects will be tailored to fit the clients needs.  This project list represents assets that have been approved by the DSM Desk and was queried from PCCS. The Operations and Maintenance services can be applied to any energy-related assets and was compiled from term sheets and IAM.  Generally those activities have been limited to a few industrial outsourcing deals including Springs, Polaroid and recently Eli Lilly. Facilities Management is usually outsourced via IPT or through the adoption of existing vendor contracts and can involve repair and maintenance for all assets.   Generally this type of activity has been focused on the retail/real estate segment.        Cheryl, pls set up a meeting with Harris, Clayton, Bouillion, Jones and Kaminski to discuss this and an action plan to develop a liability mitigation product.  I will re-present the original product concept at the meeting.  Would like to see the meeting take place late next week.  Thanks.

__label__Save	Zero curve generator for UK gilts Anjam,  Here is the model for fitting the term structure of UK gilts. The basic idea is as follows:  dirty price_{ith gilt} = Sum_{j} C_{i}/2*discount factor(t_{j,i} )+  100*discount factor(t_{Ni, i}  Using a five parameters analytical form for the discount factors, and  minimizing the sum of absolute errors, I can derive a smooth zero curve.   The model needs an  initial guess for the parameters, this may require some experience. The log file can help  you to see how well the optimization works.  Let me know if you have any questions.

__label__Save	In Confidence/Project Status Hi Vince  Id originally been told you wouldnt be back until Wednesday, and so have  another meeting booked for 4:30pm (London time) today.  I really need to  speak with you about the situation here in London re Anjam.  To be blunt,  Sharad, Kirstee and I have all been tempted to just walk out of the office  until Anjam is removed.  The major problems are: 1. I have no authority to demand Anjam should cooperate with Sharad, Kirstee  etc. on their work.  He does his best to impede their work, and I have no  ability to access his drives for data/spreadsheets. 2. Anjam removes me from the cc lists in reply to all emails received by him,  in an attempt to remove me from the loop. 3. Anjam continues to do business, and people in London still think hes  head of Research. 4. Pending your announcement, people will continue to go to Anjam, and the  business will remain dependent on him. 5. Were severely under-resourced.  Im still awaiting your review of the  email I drafted for John S, requesting additional resource.  I cant make a  big recruitment drive until I have the authority to hire more. I honestly feel I cant do my job, and Im currently asking myself what Im  even doing here.  Notwithstanding the above, here is the current picture with our projects:  Steve 1. Initiated new pre-trade system for oil trading desk.  Hooked up relevant  IT resource with business people, keeping an overall eye on making sure the  business reqts get translated into IT-speak. 2. Enron Direct demand forecasting system review. 3. Initiated global supply/demand database with coal group. 4. Constant firefighting across all desks.  Ben 1. Work on regression-based placement model. 2. General review of EnronCredit.coms quant models.  Matthew 1. Ongoing work with EnGOAL. 2. Produced first prototype of gas capacity charge optimisation tool for  Continental Gas desk.  Need to purchase local copy of CPLEX.  Kirstee 1. Diverted from Richard Lewiss request for the UK gas/power vol curves to  be sorted out, onto Eastern Virtual Power Station restructuring project.   Involves extension runs of credit reserve model, and now it seems the model  needs to be extended. 2. Constant VaR firefighting.  Slava 1. Finished all regressions and model identification for UK gas and power  demand forecasting.  We are now ready to start IT implementation. 2. Enron Direct demand forecasting system review.  Sharad 1. Exotica support/firefighting, made nearly impossible by Anjam. 2. Option on strip of metals futures for Enron Metal.  I do hope we get a chance to speak and resolve some of these issues.  Im  really not happy at present.  Best regards, Steve Steven Leppard steven.leppard@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com

Here are the details of the course (actually there are two seperate courses, one on VaR) that I promised you.  I hope to see you both again later in the month.  Best regards. Chris.     COURSE 1:   Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management --------------------------------------------------------------------------- -  Course Leaders: Dr Les Clewlow and Dr Chris Strickland  Houston: 29-30 March 2000 London:  3-4 April 2000  Fee : STG 1950 / USD 2950  This is an intermediate course aimed at the Energy professional who is familiar with energy derivative products but who requires the mathematical foundations of derivative pricing and an understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives.  This course assumes that participants are familiar with standard basic option pricing theory (the Black-Scholes formula, Monte Carlo simulation, and the use of binomial trees for option pricing).  The format for the course will follow our usual highly practical and successful style of alternate sessions of lectures and Excel based computer workshops. To facilitate intensive interaction, the course will be limited to a maximum of 15 participants so early booking is advisable.  The Excel based computer workshops deal with oil and gas as well as electricity derivatives and contain detailed calculations for pricing and risk management. At the end of the 2 days, participants leave with a diskette containing answers to all the workshops as well as valuable code for pricing and simulation.  Registration fee includes: pre-course reading, course materials, copies of relevant research materials, diskette with fully worked solutions to computer workshops, lunch and refreshments.  Additionally, each attendee will receive a free copy of Clewlow and Stricklands forthcoming book Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management which includes valuable contributions from Enrons Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson.

Dr. Les Clewlow and Dr Chris Strickland hold Associate Research Positions at both the School of Finance and Economics, University of Technology, Sydney and the Financial Options Research Centre, University of Warwick, UK.  Together they have over 20 years combined experience in the financial and energy derivative markets and have published many articles in academic and trade journals.  They are the authors of the book Implementing Derivatives Models (Wiley, 1998) and editors of Exotic Options: The State of the Art (ITP, 1998). Their forthcoming book, Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management, is due to be published during the second quarter 2000.  Currently, their interests are concentrated in the energy derivatives area, where they have developed a wide range of pricing tools for electricity options and other energy derivatives.          ----------------------- Internet Header -------------------------------- Sender: Shirley.Crenshaw@enron.com Received: from mailman.enron.com (mailman.enron.com [192.152.140.66])  by spamgaaa.compuserve.com (8.9.3/8.9.3/SUN-1.9) with ESMTP id RAA18057  for <chris_strickland@compuserve.com>; Wed, 8 Mar 2000 17:20:18 -0500 (EST) Received: from dserv1.ect.enron.com (dserv1.ect.enron.com [172.16.1.37])  by mailman.enron.com (8.8.8/8.8.8/corp-1.03) with ESMTP id WAA19791  for <chris_strickland@compuserve.com>; Wed, 8 Mar 2000 22:19:39 GMT Received: from notes.ect.enron.com (notes.ect.enron.com [172.16.4.33])  by dserv1.ect.enron.com (8.8.8/8.8.8) with SMTP id QAA23887  for <chris_strickland@compuserve.com>; Wed, 8 Mar 2000 16:20:16 -0600 (CST) Received: by notes.ect.enron.com(Lotus SMTP MTA v4.6.5  (863.2 5-20-1999))   id 8625689C.007AB2CE ; Wed, 8 Mar 2000 16:20:11 -0600 X-Lotus-FromDomain: ECT From: Shirley Crenshaw <Shirley.Crenshaw@enron.com> To: chris_strickland@compuserve.com Message-ID: <8625689C.007AB1EA.00@notes.ect.enron.com> Date: Wed, 8 Mar 2000 16:20:09 -0600 Subject: Energy Derivative Courses Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii Content-Disposition: inline Shirley Crenshaw shirley.crenshaw@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com

__label__DontSave	Re: looking for Fat Tails in time-series for NGI-SOCAL Tanya,        Sounds great.  If the objective is to model d(lnS), and we see that  vols are not constant, then one has to model vols stochastically.  If one  assumes say a log-AR(1) or other models, even for a single contract, we still  have to estimate 3 parameters.  Not a trivial task if the vols are  correlated, such as in a portfolio.  I have some older literature by  Papiancolou, Sircar and Harvey et al which tries to address and implement  some of thes issues.  I will try to dig these up.       Let me know if I can be of any help.

So what  I do care about is the  behavior of log-returns.  Any help is appreciated.  Tanya.      Naveen Andrews@ENRON 11/10/2000 04:35 PM To: Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: looking for Fat Tails in time-series for NGI-SOCAL    Tanya,                We care about PORTFOLIO VALUE CHANGES, not log-returns of a  single contract, which has extremes in the behavior and can be fit to a  fat-tailed distribution.   A 1.20 basis move, with 500 BCF position, is an  extreme event, anyway you slice it.In the literature, as elsewhere, I agree  for a single contract log-returns, they dont divide by vols.    Regards Naveen    Tanya Tamarchenko@ECT 11/10/2000 04:17 PM To: Naveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: looking for Fat Tails in time-series for NGI-SOCAL    Naveen,  I got NGI-SOCAL prices for prompt, prompt+1,...,prompt+59 contracts. For each contract I calculated moving average based on 21 log-returns as well as moving volatility. Then I calculated normalized log-returns:  [ return(t)-ave(t) ] / vol(t)  and compared the results to normal distribution.   I COULD NOT FIND Fat Tails!   Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large  returns more frequent than normal),  which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).

__label__Save	correlation matrix reduction Zhiyang,  Got your message.    As we discussed, the best way to breakdown the big correlation matrix between  different location indices is through cluster analysis.  The idea is to select major hubs and the satellite markets.  By establish the correlation between the hubs and correlation between the satellites and the hubs, the big matrix can be significantly reduced.    Then the traders only need to input the correlations between the hubs.  This technique has been applied in our Value at Risk system.  You may talk to  Tanya to find out the details.

__label__DontSave	Statistical Modelling of CDS Prices Guys  Next week were planning on recalibrating the dummified regression models (placement models) built earlier this year and last for the Enron Credit pricing system. These basically have the objective of predicting a 5-yr CDS price for an illiquid name, based on available data. This data consists of: Credit Ratings, Outlook and Watch Equity based data - eg, EDF, 90d Volatility, Beta, Market Cap, Dividend yield, PE ratio Financial ratios - eg, EBITDA interest coverage, Current ratio, EPS, Debt to Assets Descriptive Info - Country and Industry  Ive outlined the methodology used for the models thus far in the attached docs:      Were kicking off this effort next week with a brainstorming session with the trading desk, to outline areas of deficiency and proposed model improvements. From the quantitative side wed appreciate greatly if any or all of you could read these docs and offer any suggestions for improvement of the models. Any ideas on statistical techniques or the overall methodology will be welcome. Id also be happy to set up meetings or just talk on the phone if any further explanation is required.

Yesterday, I got a call from Terry Thorn, he needed economic information and  a presentation to give to EGM management.  I gave him a copy of the  conforming assets presentation, he was very pleased.  This week, Im working  on a urgent request from RAC.

I think I  know the kind of person you are, in terms of your integrity, and I admire  the high standards you set for all of us in your extended Group.  I want to let you know I am not the only one in the group who doesnt  appreciate the way Maureen disrespects you. You remain the key external  factor in their success- it is not simply their own abilities that matter  to their futures but your own- Vinces- success with upper management that  matters.  We respect you, and we dont like it when you are disrespected. Maureen  didnt disrespect me today, Vince, she disrespected you.  Its time I told you something. Last April, Maureen, highly intoxicated  following a work-related function at Ninfas, made an unsolicited predatory  sexual advance on me at my desk on the 19th floor. I was shocked and  disgusted, but I didnt say one word about this, Vince, because I played it  out and didnt want to put you into the position of having a raving Maureen  in your midst as you perhaps had to fire her and then endure a litany of  gender-bias crap lawsuits.  I took one for the team, Vince. I canrt say I would do it again- Maureen  is brazen to berate me after what she did, in public no less.  I appreciate your bringing me into Enron.

__label__Save	El Paso Statement on California Situation In case you havent already seen this:  El Paso Addresses the California Energy Situation  ( February 26, 2001 )  HOUSTON, Feb. 26 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG) reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties involved to help improve Californias energy situation. We are surprised to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning El Pasos involvement in California, said Norma Dunn, senior vice president of Corporate Communications and External Affairs at El Paso Corporation. We would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record.  The significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power, which has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate electricity. High natural gas prices are, therefore, an effect rather than a cause of the power shortage.  Allegations that natural gas prices were deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue. It is not possible for any holder of capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline to cause a significant increase in California gas prices by refusing to use that capacity. The El Paso Natural Gas pipeline is required by law to post the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate found to be just and reasonable by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. All capacity held by El Paso Merchant Energy on the El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to serve California and other Western markets.  Allegations that there was a conspiracy in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into California are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge. The facts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990s were either built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer support to justify their construction. For example, despite years of marketing efforts by Tenneco, not a single potential customer could be induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed Altamont project to proceed. For that reason alone, it was ultimately dropped. In 1996, according to estimates, there were between one and two billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of excess natural gas transportation capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving California. Indeed, it was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess capacity that prompted the California Public Utilities Commission to encourage PG&E, SoCal Edison, and SoCal Gas, beginning in 1996 and continuing into 1998, to relinquish over 1.5 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline. Processes are now under way to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity into California, and El Paso intends to do its part to help satisfy whatever needs may be established today.  As recently as last year, there were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands at that time. Notwithstanding its availability, this capacity was not used by shippers to California to fill in- state natural gas storage facilities for future use. If California had taken advantage of the opportunity in 2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999, reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in prices at the California border could have been substantially mitigated or avoided.  It is now widely recognized that the California energy crisis was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in California to keep pace with the states economy and increased demand. A combination of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices. First, the construction of new power plants in California is a slow, difficult, and heavily regulated process. As a result, the growing demand has far outstripped in-state generating capabilities. Second, unfavorable precipitation and increased out-of-state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power normally relied on by California to become unavailable. Third, increased demand for power in the western United States drove up prices that California had to pay to out-of-state generators. Fourth, state policies deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers, leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their costs. Fifth, because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased costs to consumers, the utilities creditworthiness was impaired, causing supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and expensive to purchase. Sixth, the early and greater-than-normal use of peaking units-plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand conditions-necessitated unscheduled maintenance, rendering them unavailable at critical times. Seventh, during the final months of 2000, some power plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air emissions credits. Eighth, a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold weather further drove up demand for power. Finally, the increased power costs in California could have been substantially mitigated through long-term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short-term power market.  California is currently in a difficult position, but now has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long-term energy policy, said Dunn. El Paso has been one of the largest suppliers of energy to California for more than 50 years, and we are actively participating with all parties in California to be a part of a long-term, stable solution to Californias energy needs.  El Paso Corporation, the largest and most broadly based natural gas company in the world, spans the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. With an enterprise value in excess of $50 billion, El Paso is a leader in every phase of the natural gas industry. The company owns and operates a significant portion of the North American natural gas delivery grid, operates the fastest growing, most sophisticated energy merchant group, and is the nations third largest natural gas producer. El Paso, a leader in risk management techniques, is focused on maximizing shareholder value, transforming existing markets, and speeding the development of new markets.

Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.  As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

__label__Save	Re: Sharad Update Hi Kate,  Firstly it was very useful to hold the informal discussion with him.  Sharad  seemed hesitant due to the offer not being what he expected.  He asked me  some questions about the bonus culture at Enron and suggested that it was  not as good as at investment banks that he is interviewing with.  I sold him  on the value he can extract from the excellence within the Research Group and  the ability to join a growing organisation at a critical point in, but he  still seemed reticent saying that he needs time which I understood to mean  that he was looking for a better offer elsewhere.  He is a great candidate  and it would be a real shame to lose him, given the difficulty of getting  good candidates.  I discussed this with Vince and given how much we need him in Research in  London and Vince agreed to discuss the possibility of an element of guarantee  or sign on to help him make the right decision.

We are working on the second approach to the problem: we try to come up with  a numerical estimate of the value of this option. The fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has  distributional consequences: he has something  of value he never paid for. Having a numerical estimate of  the value of this option could help to argue against it. The value of such an option is case specific;  so we shall rather  produce a template you can use for valuation case by case.

This economic  conclusion is unambiguous.  If an incumbent has the right to match an offer made by a competitor, for  an item or service of value, then few competitors will invest the time and  expense necessary to prepare and submit offers, those offers will be lower  than they would have been otherwise, and the contract will often be awarded  to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger.  In a traditional auction, where all bids are sealed and the item up for  auction is awarded to the highest bidder, we can safely predict the item will  be awarded to the bidder who values it the most, at a price reflecting the  full value of the item up for auction.  This is the efficient result in a  market economy, because the financing of the high bid reflects resources  freely allocated to the high bidder.  If the auction has open bids, we can  again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder, albeit at  a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the  highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the  second-highest valuation.  Now, in a modified auction, where an incumbent bidder has the right to match  the highest bid and retain the item for himself, each competing bidder must  justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the  following, and likely, scenario: the incumbent does not spend himself for due  diligence, but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the  top bid from a competitor.  Simply put, the incumbent with a right of first refusal can be safely  predicted to simply match their competitors bid by rule of thumb. But the  incumbents valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the  valuation of the competitor, by the amount of the due diligence and  administrative expenses.  And, the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise  of his competitors, not only in their valuations themselves, a nontrivial  financial exercise, but in any operational details required to be submitted  along with the bid.  Furthermore, in an esoteric concept known as the Winners Curse, a bidder  realizes that if his bid actually prevails, if the incumbent fails to match  it, he almost certainly overbid.  Given this, most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when  an incumbent has the right of first refusal, and those that submit a bid do  not rationally invest the time, expense and expertise necessary; they may  just fire off a low-ball bid.  After all, in almost every conceivable  state of the world arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose  money.  So, the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a  below-market price, despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest  value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its  most efficient use.

SCHULZ 03/26/2001  Traffic World  Page 25  Copyright 2001 Gale Group Inc. All rights reserved. COPYRIGHT 2001 Journal of  Commerce, Inc.  Truckers still waiting for signs of pent-up freight demand; earnings  shortfalls, layoffs loom  If you are waiting for trucking to kick-start the nations economic recovery,  pull up a chair and wait awhile. Trucking CEOs say they havent seen this  slow a first quarter in a decade.  Perhaps the weakest first quarter for freight demand since Swift became a  public company in 1990, Phoenix-based Swift Transportation Chairman and CEO  Jerry Moyes said.  The first-quarter trucking mantra historically has been this: everybody loses  money in January, hopes for a break-even February and earns whatever profit  there is in the quarter in March. That formula may not hold this year.  Gregory L. Quesnel, president and CEO of Con-Way Transportation Services and  Emery Worldwide parent CNF Inc., said the current slowdown was first detected  late in the third quarter last year and has become more pronounced in each  successive quarter. March, he said, has been as disappointing as the first  two months this year.  Layoffs already are occurring at the major LTL carriers. Yellow Freight  System has idled as many as 1,000 Teamsters and hundreds of white-collar  back-office workers. Most large carriers are warning of profit shortfalls  that will cause them to miss analysts first-quarter estimates. But there are  deeper fears, too. Marginal players may be forced into bankruptcy. Small,  family-owned carriers may be unable to exit the industry on their own terms  because of the shocking decline in the value of used trucks that is causing  some companies to be valued at less than half their worth of just two years  ago.  Swifts volume drop-off began with shipments originating on the West Coast in  January and February and it is continuing in March, Moyes said. Coupled with  reduced demand from the Southwest, Moyes said Swift will not meet analysts  first-quarter earnings expectations. Swift is not alone.  We hauled less freight in February than February a year ago, said Bob  Hammel, executive vice president of Pittsburgh-based Pitt Ohio Express, a  leading privately held Eastern regional LTL carrier. The slowdown in  manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous. Nobody  anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off.  Even Con-Way, the most profitable LTL operation in the past five years, said  it would have a decline in first-quarter operating income compared with the  year-ago period. Con-Ways tonnage declines were estimated in the  mid-single-digit percentage range.  Roadway Express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running 10 to  11 percent below those a year ago, which will result in an approximately  one-half of 1 percent (0.5 percent) decline in its operating ratio. (see  sidebar)  Pat Hanley, Overnite Transportations senior vice president and chief  financial officer, said freight figures were flat in February year over year  but rose slightly in March. Overnite is the exception to the LTL industry  with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year.  January was pretty good to us, but February was flat. Its coming back in  March. Were probably up in low single digits, 3 to 4 percent. Were picking  back up. The economy has hurt us. If you had asked us at the start of the  year, wed have said wed be up double-digits, Hanley said.  The national economic picture is a big concern, Hanley said. Were not  seeing pressure on prices, at least not so far. Were seeing customers ship  10 pallets a day instead of 20. The shipment size is coming down. Certainly  were concerned. Well do O.K., but not as great as wed like.  Forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever  stars align in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspans world. The  genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking, which  is always a first-in, first-out industry in any economic slowdown.  To hear trucking industry leaders tell it, get comfortable with beans and  franks for dinner. Its going to be awhile before its filet mignon time  again.  Shippers see whats happening as well but say its still too early in the  year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks.  All the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business  levels -- definitely slower than early last year, said Bill Huie, assistant  vice president of corporate transportation for NCH Corp., Irving, Texas.  With a couple of exceptions, carriers we talk with have no plans for  expansion in the next few months. We are getting feelers about some possible  lane adjustments to boost revenue. But generally it appears a little early in  the economic downturn for much price movement.  The national LTL carriers are seeing the same things. Our business is down  pretty substantially for the first quarter, said Roger Dick, spokesman for  Yellow Corp., parent of Yellow Freight System and two large regional LTL  carriers, Jevic Transportation, Delanco, N.J., and Saia Motor Freight,  Duluth, Ga.  USFreightways Corp., citing what it called the nations serious economic  slowdown, said it expects first-quarter earnings to fall very substantially  below current Wall Street consensus.  Extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating  environment, USF Chairman, President and CEO Samuel K. Skinner added.  Traditionally, the first quarter builds momentum slowly, with March being  the strongest month of the period, Skinner said in a statement. This year,  the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in January  and February, softening even the normal modest expectations for those two  months.  Its not just the LTL industry thats hurting. The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter  truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand-supply  relationship since analyst James J. Valentine began tracking the data in  April 1994. Two events can cause weakness in the index, according to  Valentine. They are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak  freight demand.  So far in 2001, we have seen the confluence of both factors, but the  fall-off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply, Valentine wrote  in his most recent Trucking Snapshot for early March.  Year-to-date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over  year, according to Valentines index, while supply is up only 7 percent. That  would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was  masked by the strong economy, Valentine says.  In a more ominous note, Valentine believes overcapacity will continue to  plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years. Only a  reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand-supply back in balance  for the truckload sector in the near term, Valentine predicts.  The overproduction of new Class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last  year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at  manufacturers, wholesalers and other retailers. Used trucks have lost on  average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months.  Anecdotally, one used truck dealer, Music City Truck & Equipment, in  LaVergne, Tenn., is holding a two-for-one sale on three- to five-year-old  Class 8 Freightliners. You can buy two for around $30,000, less than a brand  new Chevy Suburban SUV.  What that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 Class 8 truck for $70,000 and  depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the  books this year at $35,000. But assuming it has lost 30 percent of that  value, it may only be worth $24,500 in actuality. For a carrier with a  100-truck fleet, that equates to a loss of more than $1 million on assets.  The glut may last for a while, according to Valentines analysis. Assuming a  three-year trade-in cycle, most of the Class 8 tractors in the truckload  sector are just now rolling over to the used-truck market. That means that  overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year.  That will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business, as  did nearly 1,900 carriers last year that either closed or declared  bankruptcy.  We can see from indexes, surveys and other information available to us that  it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in March and freight  demands will continue to be soft throughout the month. Based on all of these  factors, we expect USFreightways profits for the first quarter to be very  substantially less than published analysts forecasts, Skinner said.  In addition, severe weather conditions including an earthquake in Seattle,  rainstorms in California and blizzards in the Northeast have added cost and  decreased efficiencies, Skinner added.  Expectations at each of USFs operating companies have been affected, some  more than others. The LTL, logistics, reverse logistics and  freight-forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a  similar period last year, Skinner said.  Further job cuts at USF Worldwide, its freight forwarder, would be in the  offing as cost controls at the unit would be accelerated in the wake of the  softening economy, Skinner said. Late last year, Skinner said the rebuilding  process at USF Worldwide would be a two-year process. But the worsening  economy has made that rebuilding job harder, he said.  We are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is, in fact, further  impeding progress in this area, Skinner said. During the fourth quarter of  2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001, the company has taken  steps to increase cost efficiencies. Among these actions are a substantial  cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force.  These cost-control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance  the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions.  In the 2000 first quarter, USF posted $22.3 million net income, a 27 percent  rise from the $17.5 million earnings in the 1999 first quarter. At the time,  that was USFs 15th straight quarter-over-quarter earnings increase. It came  on $608.2 million revenue, an 18.5 percent rise in from the $513.2 million  revenue in the 1999 first quarter. Analysts had been estimating USF to earn  about $3.50 a share earnings for 2001, compared with actual $3.61 earnings  per share for all of last year. In the fourth quarter last year, USF earned  $23.7 million, or 91 cents a share.

__label__Save	EOL Data Mining Vince,  Here are four graphs I came up with yesterday afternoon that may be of  interest:  The first one shows what percentage of our trades are done with different  counterparties -    (Note the large part that Aquila plays!)  The other three graphs look at how trading volume varies during the week  between the hours of 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM for different categories of product.  Natural gas and power have their own graphs, as they have the largest traded  volumes. Products is for the remaining categories.    There are still some things I would like to take a look at. The databeacon  software is now available, and can be reached at the following URL:  http://sassy.ect.enron.com/eol/eol_all.html  Do you have any specific questions that you would like me to try answering  regarding EOL?  I have also started doing some research on automated trading platforms. Are  there any websites and/or papers you would recommend I read?

__label__Save	CME and CATEX ---------------------- Forwarded by Joseph Hrgovcic/HOU/ECT on 04/05/2000  04:06 PM ---------------------------   Lucy Ortiz 04/05/2000 04:02 PM To: Joseph Hrgovcic/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: CME and CATEX  Spotlight Report    Exchange products seeing slow trading   GAVIN SOUTER    03/20/2000    Business Insurance    Page 3    Copyright (C) 2000 Crain Communications, Inc. All rights   reserved.     Exchange-based insurance products developed in recent years have   been somewhat slow to get off the ground.    Although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since   the mid-1990s to cover insurance risks, none so far has posted a   significant volume of trades.    Few insurers, reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away   from the traditional insurance markets, where capacity remains   abundant and relatively cheap.    As long as those traditional markets manage to weather major   natural catastrophes, the allure of the exchange-based products will   remain limited, observers say.    Also stifling the growth of the exchange-based contracts is the   limited number of contracts available, one expert noted. Dealers, he   said, are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one   contract against another.    Although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to   establish a widely used set of new risk financing products, that has   not been achieved, said Morton Lane, senior managing director,   capital markets division at Gerling Global Financial Products in   New York.    The main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not   offer a sufficiently diverse array of products, he said. The only way   to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified   portfolio of other contracts, and none of the exchanges currently   offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that   hedge, he said.    Florida windstorm options, for example, cannot be bought and then   hedged in the same way that International Business Machines Corp.   stock options contracts can be hedged with IBM stock, Mr. Lane   explained.    The exchanges might be more attractive to investors if, in addition to   natural catastrophe options, they included options on other risks, he   said. Those might include, for example, satellite, aviation and crop   indexes, Mr. Lane said. For the insurance buyer, such exchange   instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle, but   as long as they are quantifiable and indexable, they may represent a   good surrogate, he said.    The exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for   over-the-counter securitized deals, if there are regular issuers of   catastrophe bonds, Mr. Lane said.    The soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of   exchange-based insurance products, said Sean F. Mooney, senior   vp and chief economist at Guy Carpenter & Co., the reinsurance   brokerage unit of Marsh Inc. in New York.    The traditional market has been so competitive that people are not   looking for other ways of doing business, he said.    At least in concept, the exchange-based deals are generally similar   to the mortgage-backed securities that have been a huge success   since they were introduced in the 1970s. There is a belief that   alternative means of transferring risks will grow, but it is difficult to   predict when, Mr. Mooney said.    Currently, the trading that is taking place typically involves   established insurers and reinsurers, so the exchanges have not   brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace, he said.    Guy Carpenter provided the index for the Bermuda Commodities   Exchange reinsurance products. The BCE did not take off,   however, and was suspended last year after two years of little   activity.    The oldest of the insurance-related, exchange-based derivative   products are the catastrophe options traded on the Chicago Board   of Trade, which began trading the options in 1996.    Initially, there was substantial interest in the options, but the soft   traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge   catastrophe exposures, said Carlton Purty, an independent broker   at the CBOT who trades in options.    No catastrophe option trades have been completed at the CBOT   so far this year, he said. Last year, there was increased interest in   the contracts because of Hurricane Floyd, but few contracts were   traded, Mr. Purty said.    I think a major, major catastrophe will have to happen before they   really take off, he said.    The contracts offer real protection, and options dealers are keen to   trade in a new niche, but the conventional insurance and reinsurance   markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative   coverage options, Mr. Purty said.    The Catastrophe Risk Exchange, located in Princeton, N.J., has   radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in   mid-1996, and it is well positioned to expand, said Frank Sweeney,   chief operating officer.    CATEX initially planned to be a computer-based facility for   reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks   and to build balanced portfolios.    But by the time the exchange was operational in November 1996, it   was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in CATEX   wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance, Mr. Sweeney   said.    Although there was some interest in risk swapping, only a handful of   risks were posted on the system, and none was traded, Mr.   Sweeney said.    Consequently, CATEX has become chiefly a cash for cover   exchange, he said, noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange   include property catastrophe coverage, aviation and liability   coverages. CATEX also trades industry loss warranties, where   coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry   loss over an agreed threshold.    Other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible   through the Internet in November 1998. And late last year, CATEX   offered users the ability to set up smaller networks, allowing them   form groups whose members do business only with one another.    Since its inception, CATEX has completed about 450 trades,   totaling $400 million in premium and more than $3 billion in limits,   he said. CATEXs roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers,   insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their   captives, Mr. Sweeney said.    We obviously have a long way to go, but we are pretty satisfied   with what we have achieved so far, Mr. Sweeney said.    The exchange sees increased activity after major losses, as cedents   seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their   existing cover, he said. For example, Mr. Sweeney said, there was   a flurry of activity after the European windstorms in December last   year.    Last September, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered the field   of insurance-related derivatives when it began offering weather   derivatives .    Thus far, 420 futures contracts have been traded, said Larry   Grannan, senior director in product marketing at the CME.    Such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against   weather-related losses. For example, a utility may sell less power in   a mild winter, and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a   resultant fall in revenues.    The exchange first offered heat-based indexes for Atlanta, Chicago,   Cincinnati and New York. In January, it added Philadelphia, Dallas,   Des Moines, Las Vegas, Tucson and Portland, and it began offering   contracts based on cold weather.    Currently, most of the trades are between securities dealers   themselves, but, eventually, the contracts will likely be used more   extensively by utilities and insurers, Mr. Grannan said.    In addition, the futures contracts could be used as hedges for   over-the-counter securitized deals, he said.     Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

I am very interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him over to the States  where we lack desperately technical talent. Can you help us by interviewing him in Sydney?  The main determination I need from you is whether he can function in a company like Enron. As any good academic he sent his resume in a ps format and I shall fax you a copy in case you dont have a PostScript reader on your system.  3. Christian Werner does some really neat things on the weather front. I would like to determine if he can help us to upgrade our systems. Can we bring him to Houston for a week to discuss the weather forecasting  technology with  Mike  Roberts and Joe Hrgovcic?

__label__Save	Alliance Info Alert Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:  This Alliance Info Alert includes three items of interest: 1)  The weekly Alliance Express newsletter 2)  Listing of recent filings at FERC 3)  Timeline for FERC action on California Markets  (attached)                          Alliance of Energy Suppliers Express=02=05December 1= 9, 2000  INSIDE WASHINGTON  =02=05 FEDERAL AFFAIRS  ***FERC De-Federalizes California Markets, Adopts Other Structural Reforms*= **  At a special meeting Friday afternoon, FERC unanimously approved its eagerl= y awaited final order reforming the California wholesale markets, adopting th= e major outlines of its November 1 proposed order and sending back to California the responsibility for addressing state-related matters.  At the=  same time, FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well=  as the imposition of region-wide price caps.  FERC reiterated their earlier=  conclusions that under certain circumstances, California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to Californias seriously flawed market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the West.  FERC adopted the November proposal to eliminate, effective immediately, the=  states mandatory requirement that the states investor-owned utilities buy=  and sell electricity through the PX, and allow these utilities to purchase=  electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to=  manage supply risks.  FERC terminated the PXs rate schedules effective at=  the close of business on April 30, 2001.  In effect, as Chairman James Hoecker stated, the order de-federalizes 60 percent of the California wholesale market established under the states restructuring law, returning=  ratemaking authority over company-owned generation to the California Public=  Utilities Commission (CPUC).  The agency also modified the effective period of the $150/MWh soft cap proposal, limiting its application through April 2001, whereupon a comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which incorporates appropriate thresholds, screen and mitigation measures must b= e in place.  In a related move, FERC ordered a technical conference early nex= t year to develop such a program by March 1, 2001, so that these measures can=  be place by the May 1, deadline.  ***Energy Secretary Issues Order to Power Generators and Marketers To Bolst= er Californias Supplies***  Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has responded to the severely constrained=  power supply situation in California by issuing an order, pursuant to Secti= on 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, to require generators and marketers to mak= e power available to meet the states electricity needs.  The emergency directive requires that, if the California independent system operator (ISO= ) certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity, certain suppliers would be required to make power available to the ISO if they have=  power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm=  customers. Those suppliers that have provided power to the California power=  exchange (PX) and the ISO over the last 30 days that have firm capacity available would be subject to the order.  Under the order, the ISO is required to provide notice to each supplier subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by 9:00 pm=  EST on the day before the requested service.  The ISO must, to the extent=  feasible, allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each suppliers available power.  The price for the power provided pursuant to t= he order will be set by an agreement between the ISO and the supplier.  If no=  agreement is reached, FERC is to determine the just and reasonable rate at = a later date.   The order will remain in effect until 3:00 am EST on December=  21, 2000 unless modified.  ***EPA Sets Plans to Regulate Plants Mercury Emissions***  EPA Administrator Carol Browner, in a long-awaited announcement, indicated=  last week that the Administration will require reductions of mercury emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants.  The agency stated that it=  plans to propose new regulations in December 2003, and hopes to finalize ne= w rules by December 2004.  In the wake of the decision, EEI called on EPA to make certain that any program to control utilities mercury emissions be based on the best scientific information available in order to assure the protection of publi= c health.  EEI urges EPA to maintain its commitment to resolving the key scientific and technological issues, said Paul Bailey, EEI Vice President,=  Environmental Affairs.  Given these uncertainties, EEI is disappointed that=  the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science, said Mr. Bail= ey.  In the meantime, the electric power industry will continue to work with al= l stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions=  from power plants may be needed, and how those cuts should be achieved, Mr= . Bailey concluded.  MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS   ***Calpine Completes Acquisition of EMI Power Assets***  Calpine Corporation has announced that it has completed the acquisition of=  power assets from Energy Management, Inc. (EMI).  In the deal, Calpine acquired the remaining interest in three recently constructed, combined-cyc= le power generating facilities located in New England, as well as a joint marketing venture between Calpine and EMI.  Prior to the transaction, Calpi= ne held a 50 percent net interest in the projects.  We are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of these new and highly efficient power plants.  The Dighton, Tiverton, and Rumford faciliti= es were among the first merchant power plants to enter commercial operation in=  New England, said Calpine Senior Vice President Bob Alff.  Combined with=  our other announced project in the Northeast, we have created a coordinated=  system of low-cost assets, with excellent geographic diversity, to provide=  power to a very attractive New England market, added Alff.  ***Exelon Completes Acquisition of 49.9 Percent of Sithe***  Exelon Corporation and Sithe Energies have announced the completion of Exelons acquisition of 49.9 percent of the stock of Sithe.  The completion=  of the acquisition finalizes an agreement in which PECO Energy Company agre= ed to purchase 49.9 percent of Sithes assets in North America for $682 million.  PECO has since merged with Unicom Corporation to form Exelon Corporation.  Under the terms of the agreement, Exelon has the option to purchase the remaining 50.1 percent of Sithe within two to five years at a price based o= n prevailing market conditions when the purchase option is exercised.  Exelon=  and Sithe will continue to operate independently, said the companies.  ENERGY DATA  *** Weekly Electric Output (Week 50)***  Electric output reached 74,737 GWh for the week ending December 9 (Week 50)= , with the highest increase over 1999 levels in the Mid-Atlantic region, whic= h had a 15.8 percent increase over 1999.  Looking at year-to-date information= , the Pacific Southeast leads the nation in growth of output.  For more information, email alliance@eei.org.  WHOS WHO  ***Allegheny Energy Announces Leadership Change***  Allegheny Energy, Inc. this week announced the appointment of Michael Morrell, Senior Vice President and CFO, as President of its unregulated supply business, Allegheny Energy Supply Company, effective February 1, 2001.  Morrell will replace Peter Skrgic, current President, who will be retiring on that date after 37 years of service to the company.  In his new position, Mr. Morrell will direct and continue the growth of Alleghenys energy supply business, which operates and markets competitive=  retail and wholesale electric generation throughout the eastern US.

__label__DontSave	EIA to Display Draft of New Storage Survey at GasMart/Power 2002 EIA to Display Draft of New Storage Survey at GasMart/Power 2002  Dulles, VA -- January 25, 2002-The Energy Information Administration will display its plans for a new weekly natural gas storage survey, as part of an extensive program exploring the wholesale gas and power markets at GasMart/Power 2002, March 18-20 in Reno, NV, hosted by Intelligence Press, Inc. In a special session Wednesday, March 20, 2002, EIA Senior Analyst Roy Kass will outline the agencys new weekly natural gas storage survey which will replace the current survey conducted by the American Gas Association. Due for release in early May, EIAs survey is expected to become the most critical piece of data informing the market. During the conference, attendees also will be able to visit EIAs Showcase area to see and discuss with its creators, the draft version of the agencys new product. In other sessions at the 16th annual GasMart/Power forum key natural gas and power representatives will come together to hear about strategies in the current low energy price, high security environment, and --- the impact on the competitive market of the collapse of Enron, the markets largest and most zealous supporter. Keynoter Richard Sherrill, Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer of Duke Energy North America will assess the state of the wholesale natural gas and power market, offering his strategies for instilling customer confidence in the face of the wrenching market disruptions of the last few years. He also will offer his views as to the market share for electronic trading and the outlook for electric restructuring?  Energy guru Ben Schlesinger will explore the impact of Enrons collapse on other marketers; on rules and regulations; and on the political scene.  Will Congress intervene to re-control gas and power prices?  How long will energy investors shy away from major commitments?  Are we in for another boom-bust price cycle? Did the skyrocketing energy prices in California and other parts of the nation in the latter half of 2000 and early 2001 carry the seeds of the current bust, weakening industrial customers, bankrupting the largest marketer, and ultimately reversing gains in the competitive market? In others of the 18 sessions at GasMart/Power 2002, Dynegy Vice President Peter Esposito and Jim Macias, Sr. Vice President of Calpine tell whats ahead for power generation. ?Williams Energy Marketing & Trading President Bill Hobbs and TXU Vice President Jeff Shorter assess the winter...Futures analyst Cynthia Kase instructs on technical market analysis ?

__label__Save	MG METALS: Quant Analysis & Risk Hi Eric,  Thanks for getting back to me - I believe there are a number of issues to  address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk management  and quantitative analysis perspective, and I have put together a (by no means  exhaustive) list:-  i) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic  options linking perspective (e.g. their spreadsheets link to different option  pricing add-ins) ii) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we  can capture metals risk in our VaR system (we will require historical data  for this). iii) ensure that MG staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our  methods and systems and vice versa  These tasks will involve a significant degree of cross-communication with  relevant contacts within MG metals, and so I look forward to starting on the  process as soon as possible - I hope to play a full part from a quantitative  research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes  smoothly in this exciting new development, so please do not hesitate to  involve me.

__label__Save	Combinatorial Auction - Jan 11 mtg background ----- Forwarded by Greg Woulfe/Enron Communications on 12/28/00 09:58 AM -----   Chonawee Supatgiat@ENRON  12/22/00 05:08 PM        To: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Greg Woulfe/Enron Communications@Enron  Communications    cc:     Subject: Combinatorial Auction  Stinson and Greg,  I have read the paper Combinatorial Auction with Multiple Winners for  Universal Service from Richard Steinberg and Frank Kelly. They propose a  combinatorial auction which is an auction for multiple items that allows  bidders to realize their synergies on combinations of items. The  combinatorial auction is appropriated for bandwidth commodity because most  bidders in the market have synergies on the combination of items. For  example, if we want to get bandwidth between Boston and DC, we would bid for  Boston-NY and NY-DC. It will be valuable to us only if we won both links. If  we won only one link, it will be useless.  In the paper, they propose the auctioning method but their method has not  been tested or validated yet. I have not checked their proposition  mathematically but their paper was published in Management Science so I think  it should be all right. I will look at it in more details and let you know.  Anyhow, there are also other combinatorial auctions that are actually used,  for example, the Alberta governments PPA auction that Enron Canada was  participated 3-4 months ago.  Based on our long position on bandwidth, Auction and Exchange might be a good  channel to dispose our unused (or unsold) bandwidth. I know there is not much  demand in the market. But if we open a combinatorial auction or exchange, we  might be able to increase our market share. (by taking demand from our  competitors). I believe, at the moment, there are no bandwidth exchanges that  allow combinatorial bids. If we are the first one to do it, we might  improve our sale channel and gain some market share. (Note: Auction -> one  seller and many buyers: Exchange -> many sellers and many buyers.)  Moreover, I think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because we  cannot sell them anyway. In addition, we ourselves can be a dummy bidder in  the system and bid in the auction. If the current wining bid is too low, we  can just over-bid it and keep the product. This way, we can indirectly put a  reserve price on the products.  Lets meet sometime in the first week of January. -Chonawee Greg Woulfe greg.woulfe@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com  Russell Woody russell.woody@enron.com  Marcello Romano marcello.romano@enron.com  Paul Racicot paul.racicot@enron.com  Jim Fallon jim.fallon@enron.com

These options=  are exercised sequentially--over the life of the DSM installation--wheneve= r the customer experiences a dramatic, stochastic spike in electricity pric= e, associated with a lognormal price distribution.

Knowledge may be the most important source of competitive advantage for a firm, but capturing the potential gains is a continuing challenge. Firms are filing patent applications at an unprecedented rate, while struggling to keep up with accelerating development cycles and shrinking lead times. Emerging technologies, changing legal interpretations and growing administrative burdens on the patent system are creating a new and unfamiliar context for the management of intellectual property. In response, firms are rethinking their strategies for realizing the rewards from their innovation. The Mack Center at the Wharton School has assembled thought leaders from leading companies, government and academia to address issues such as the following: - What strategies are firms using to create, protect and use their knowledge assets? - Do mechanisms such as secrecy, control of complementary assetsand lead time play an important role as a substitute or supplement for patent protection? - How is the U.S. patent and trademark office responding to the remarkable growth in patenting? Should they be protecting not only inventions but also ways of distributing and selling them? How should they deal with applications for patents on sequences of the human genome? - In a world where technology is developed and employed globally, what are the prospects for international harmonization of intellectual property laws and practice? - Are the patent office and the courts up to the task of creating and effectively enforcing clear intellectual property rights for emerging technologies?

Research will continue working on custom reporting off of EnronOnline  data.  2). Research will continue working on market analysis off of EnronOnline data  3). Research will a contribute a resource to the Trading Algorithm effort,  presumably one at this point in time. I would prefer it to be Vasant but I am  flexible.The Trading Algorithm group will be run by the EnronOnline team with  its product reviewed by Research. It is my belief that projects like this  require a firm commercial hand in their infancy to make sure they stay on the  right track.

__label__Save	Yesterdays power outage As you are painfully aware, we had a power outage Wednesday morning in the  Enron Building.  This outage was caused by localized structural failure of  the raised floor in our 34th floor Data Center.  This resulted in disruption  to the power distribution system servicing the phone switch and a number of  ENA servers.  As a cautionary move, Enron OnLine was interrupted while the extent of the  failure was assessed, resulting in the system being unavailable from 11:23 to  11:39.  All Enron Building telephones and voicemail were unavailable for  approximately one hour and 20 minutes and certain ENA trading systems were  unavailable for over two hours.  During this time the power was stabilized  and systems were restored.  Immediate steps are being taken to correct this  problem.   We apologize for this inconvenience.

__label__DontSave	Extra secure NETWORK WORLD NEWSLETTER: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE 11/27/01 - Todays focus: Extra secure  Dear Wincenty Kaminski,  In this issue:  * Novell adds new partners to NMAS * Links related to Novell NetWare * Featured reader resource  _______________________________________________________________ HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDE  If youre looking for a gift for that special network executive, or if youre a network executive looking for gifts for your family or friends, odds are weve played with, errr, tested a device that could do the trick. Check out our Holiday Gift Guide to help make this years shopping easier! http://nww1.com/go/ad206.html  _______________________________________________________________ Todays focus: Extra secure  By Dave Kearns  Novell has announced some new biometric-related partners for its Novell Modular Authentication Service, or NMAS. SAFLINK, AuthenTec, Iridian Technologies, Biometricate and Precise Biometrics have recently released technology to integrate their products with NMAS.  NMAS allows you to specify different methods of authentication, either singly or in any combination, with the possibility of basing authorizations on the authentication method used. The traditional Username/Password combination is supported, as well as smart cards (or tokens), proximity cards, digital certificates or biometrics.  The new partnerships announced are all in the biometric area, covering iris-scans and fingerprints, adding to the already large number of biometric-security vendors supporting NMAS. Vendors and their products include:  * AuthenTec - AuthenTecs FingerLoc and Entr?Pad fingerprint   authentication products read fingerprints below the surface   layer of the skin, resulting in more accurate acquisition and   recognition rates.  * Biometricate - Biometricates fingerprint authentication   software will generate a complete audit trail of every   authentication transaction. Whether the authentication attempt   is a success or failure, a record is created incorporating   details such as server and client IP addresses, date and time,   and the users logon credentials, including the finger that was   used for the authentication.  * Iridian - Iris recognition from Iridian Technologies is based   on the rich detail of the iris of the eye and scales to support   millions of users.  * Precise Biometrics - Precise Biometrics Precise 100 product   family for fingerprint recognition has been on the market since   1999.  All of these new partners function with NMAS via SAFLINKs SAFmodule, which integrates a variety of biometric technologies into the NMAS authentication infrastructure, including fingerprint, voice, facial and iris recognition. SAFmodule also provides specialized features such as support for user self- enrollment, a biometric tutorial module and a disconnected login capability for mobile users.  The partners join previously announced NMAS security partnerships that include ActivCard, Applied Biometrics, Arcot Systems, BioID, Biometric Access Corporation, Cherry Corporation, Compaq, Entrust Technologies, Identix Incorporated, RSA Security, SAFLINK, SecuGen, SmartTrust, Systemneeds, VASCO, Veridicom and VisionSphere.  Authentication and authorization have gone way past simple password control.

Thanks a lot for your help again. Have a great weekend.  Jens    Jens Gobel 10/26/2000 12:06 PM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: Forward oil prices     Vince,  As discussed on the phone, I am sending you the request that I have received  from Prof. Buehler. Prof. Buehler is the  head of the faculty of finance at Mannheim University in Germany. Currently,  he is writing a study about the hedging  strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle. For this study he would  like to get forward oil prices form us.  The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point  for the time period July 1986 and December 1996  with remaining contract durations between one and ten years. It would be  ideal to get this data on a daily basis. Weekly  or monthly data is helpful as well, of course.   Since Mannheim University is among Enrons tier one recruiting universities  in Germany, it would be great if we could help  him with some data. Thanks a lot for your help.  Jens      o.korn@uni-mannheim.de on 10/10/2000 11:44:57 AM To: Jens.Gobel@enron.com cc:    Subject: Daten   Sehr geehrter Herr Goebel,  bezugnehmend auf Ihr heutiges Telefongespraech mit Herrn Prof. Buehler hat mich Prof. Buehler gebeten, Ihnen genauer darzustellen, welche Daten idealerweise fuer unsere Studie benoetigt wuerden.  Zunaechst zum Hintergrund. Wir sind auf ENRON gestossen, weil Eduardo Schwartz in einer seiner Arbeiten die folgende Datenquelle angibt:   In addition to the publicly available futures data described above, for the purpose of this study Enron Capital and Trade Resources made available some proprietary historical forward price curves from 1/15/93 to 5/16/96. From these data ten forward prices were used in estimation, ranging in maturities from two months to nine years  Dies laesst uns annehmen, dass Enron bestimmte Daten verfuegbar hat.  Nun zum idealen Datensatz:  Forwardoelpreise (am besten WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing) fuer Restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn Jahren fuer den Zeitraum Juli 1986 bis Dezember 1996. Dabei waere eine hohe Datenfrequenz ideal (taeglich, ansonsten woechentlich oder monatlich). Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing nuetzlich.  Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht erfuellen lassen. Jedoch waere uns auch schon geholfen, wenn ein kuerzerer Zeitraum oder eine niedrigere Datenfrequenz vorlaege.  Wir waernen Ihnen sehr dankbar, wenn Sie in Erfahrung bringen koennten, inwiefern solche Daten von Enron zu erhalten sind.  Herzlichen Dank fuer Ihre Muehe und beste Gruesse  Olaf Korn   p.s.

I get back to you shortly with some points regarding the  usefulness of EVT and how traders (electricity and weather) can benefit from  EVT.   Cheers, Christian      To: Christian Werner/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc:    Subject: Re: extreme value theory applied to weathet    Christian:  To my knowledge, the research group is examining EVT primarily in the context  of Value at Risk calculations.  We have not looked at EVT for power, because,  to date, we have been focussing on shorter term fundamental forecasting of  price excursions: i.e. given tomorrows load forecasts and expected plant  dispatch, we attempt to predict which lines will become constrained and how  the system will react to alleviate these constraints. I would be interested  in your thoughts on how EVT would benefit the traders however.  As far as the  weather goes, I would expect the weather desk to use EVT at some level.   Clearly you should talk to Joe Hrgovcic, the researhc chap attached to the  weather desk, for a more accurate assessment.  Cheers, Grant.

We  spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book, and?   you kindly offered that you would provide this. Is this still?  possible? We realise that you are extremely busy, so Chris and Les  went? ahead and wrote something, which is below, and if you want to  review, change or? re-write the preface, that would be very  appreciated. Let me know? what your thoughts   are.  Thanks, Julie (were getting  close)    Preface        One of our main  objectives in? writing Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management  has been to bring? together as many of the various approaches  for  the pricing and risk management? energy derivatives as possible, to  discuss  in-depth the models, and to show how? they relate to each  other. In this? way we hope  to help the reader to analyse the  different models, price a wide? range of  energy derivatives, or to  build a risk management system which uses a? consistent modelling  framework. We? believe that for practitioners this last point is   very important and we continue? to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk? management and giving  arbitrage opportunities  to your competitors by using? ad-hoc and  inconsistent models for different instruments and markets (see also OTHERS  WHO PROPOSE CONSISTENT? MODELS?). However, it is not? our wish to  concentrate on one particular model or  models, at the exclusion of?  the others because we believe that the choice should  rest with the  user? (although it will probably be clear from our discussions  the model(s) we? prefer). We therefore try and give? as clear  account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all the?  models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which? best suit their needs.    In order to meet our  objectives the? book is divided into 11 chapters. ? In chapter 1  we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to?  model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the?  book. In addition to introducing? the techniques that underlie the  Black-Scholes modelling framework we outline? the numerical techniques  of trinomial trees  and Monte Carlo simulation for? derivative pricing,  which are used throughout the book.    In Chapter 2 we discuss  the? analysis of spot energy prices. As? well as analysing  empirical price movements we propose a number of processes? that   can be used to model the prices. ? We look at the well-know process of  Geometric Brownian Motion as well as? mean reversion, stochastic  volatility and jump processes, discussing each and? showing how they  can be simulated and their parameters estimated.    Chapter 3,  written by Vince? Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of   Enron Corp., discusses volatility? estimation in energy commodity  markets. ? This chapter builds on the previous one. It examines in  detail the methods,?  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation  process assuming different? pricing models introduced in chapter 2.  ? Examples from crude, gas, and electricity markets are used to  illustrate? the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating  volatility.    Chapter 4 examines forward curves? in the  energy markets. Although? such  curves are well understood and  straight-forward in the most financial? markets, the difficulty of  storage in many energy markets leads to less well? defined  curves. In  this chapter we? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and  the building of forward? curves from market instruments. We?  outline the three  main approaches which have been applied to building  forward? curves in energy markets; the arbitrage approach, the  econometric approach, and? deriving analytical values by modelling  underlying stochastic factors.    Chapter 5 presents an overview  of? structures found in the energy derivative markets and discusses  their uses. Examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety  of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as  energy swaptions, compound  options, Asian options, barrier options, lookback  options, and ladder  options.    Chapter 6 investigates single and? multi-factor  models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard?  energy derivatives. Closed form? solutions for forward prices, forward  volatilities, and European option prices? both on the spot and  forwards are derived and presented for all the models in? this chapter  including a three factor, stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model.    Chapter 7 shows how the prices of? path dependent  and American style options  can be evaluated for the models in? Chapter  6. Simulation schemes are? developed for the evaluation of European  style options and applied to a variety? of  path dependent options. In  order? to price options which incorporate early   exercise opportunities, a trinomial? tree scheme is developed. This  tree? is built to  be consistent with the observed forward curve and  can be used to? price exotic  as well as standard European and American  style options.    Chapter 8 describes a methodology? for  valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market  observed? forward curve. The approach results? in a multi-factor  model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range  of energy forward curves. ? The user defined volatility structures can  be of an extremely general? form. Closed-form solutions are?  developed  for pricing standard European options, and efficient Monte  Carlo? schemes are presented for pricing exotic options. The chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of American style  options.    Chapter 9 focuses on the risk? management of  energy derivative positions. ?  In this chapter we discuss the  management of price risk for institutions? that trade options or other  derivatives and who are then faced with the problem?  of managing the  risk through time. ? We begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look? at extensions to gamma  hedging ?  illustrating the techniques using both spot and? forward  curve models. The general? model presented in Chapter 8 is ideally  suited to multi-factor hedging of a?  portfolio of energy derivatives  and this is also discussed.    Chapter 10 examines the key  risk? management concept of Value at Risk (VaR) applied to portfolios  containing? energy derivative products. After?  discussing the  concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs?  (volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated. We then  compare the fours major? methodologies for computing VaR; Delta,  Delta-gamma, historical simulation and? Monte-Carlo simulation,  applying each to the same portfolio  of energy? options. In this  chapter we also? look at testing the VaR estimates  for various  underlying energy market? variables.    Finally, in Chapter  11 we review? modelling approaches to credit risk. ? We  look in  detail at two quite different approaches, CreditMetrics (J. P. Morgan   (1997)) and? CreditRisk+ (Credit Suisse Financial? Products  (1997)) for which  detailed information is publicly available. Together  these provide an extensive set?  of tools with which to measure credit  risk. We present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy  derivatives.   Before? we begin we stress that the models and  methods we present in this  book are tools? which should be used with  the benefit of an understanding of how  both the ?tool?? and the market  works. The? techniques we describe are certainly  not ?magic wands?  which can be waved at? data and risk management problems to provide  instant and perfect solutions. To quote from the RiskMetrics   Technical Document ?? no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace  experience and professional judgement in managing risk.?. ? However,  the right tools,  correctly used make the job a lot?  easier!

__label__Save	Iraq and Crude Output An interesting piece of information from the oil markets.  Iraq is trying to extract concessions from the US and threatens to shut down production as of Oct 1 (just in time for the US elections).  The source of this info is Phil Verlaeger (an oil analyst). He is very good but excessively concerned with Iraqi machinations. He is the source of news (reported by Friedman of the New York Times in his op-ed columns) about massive Iraqi trading in the oil futures markets. I personally discount this info: the volume and  transparency of the oil markets  would not support this type of huge scale operations by  Saddams government. There may be some trading by Iraqi officials on the side.

__label__DontSave	Meeting and Event Expenditure The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.    EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo.  The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.  Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.  1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman 2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA. 3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form. 4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the EA Office of the Chairman for final approval.  Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.  If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

__label__Save	Japanese Power Market Another article I thought you might find interesting.  Regards,    Eugenio  Review of energy policies kicks off     Asahi Shimbun   April 25, 2000   A government advisory panel on Monday embarked on a comprehensive review of energy-related policies.   ``We want to come up with feasible policies and at the same time clearly present reasons for those policies, Yoichi Kaya, a professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo, told a meeting of the Coordination Subcommittee under the Advisory Committee for Energy, an advisory panel to Minister of International Trade and Industry Takashi Fukaya. Kaya chairs the subcommittee.   The nuclear development policy, including the governments goal for building new nuclear power plants, is expected to be a focus of the discussions.   A spate of nuclear accidents have made construction of plants increasingly difficult, and the nations power suppliers have reduced the number of new nuclear power plants expected to be in operation by fiscal 2010 from 20 to 13.   The subcommittee, set up for the first time in about 10 years, is made up of about 30 members, and members of anti-nuclear nongovernmental organizations have been included for the first time.   Some members told Mondays meeting that the government must stop taking the nuclear development policy for granted and seriously look into the possibility of introducing renewable energy, such as wind and solar power.   Also on the agenda will be energy saving measures.   Energy consumption in the residential and commercial sector, made up of homes and offices, and in the transportation sector, which includes cars and trucks, has almost doubled over the past 25 years.   At Mondays meeting, many members stressed the need to change public consciousness toward the use of energy.   MITI plans to present studies on how life would be affected by compulsory energy saving measures such as automatically turning off air conditioners at certain temperatures or vehicle engines when they are idle.

__label__Save	EOL WTI Historical Trade Simulation - more profitable trading strategy Please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue, which contains some  typos.    Greg and John,  I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of  trades ( keeping the  total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially  because in a trending market we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose  market move from $30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL and the half bid-offer spread  is $1 for simplicity, we take 5  trades of short positions, the total MTM for that day is  (-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$150,000 and total trading  volume is 50,000 BBL short.  If per trade volume is 50,000 BBL, we take one  trade, the total MTM is  -5*50,000= -$250,000.   Thus the net difference between the two trading  strategies is $10,000 for that particular day.  Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the  number of trades, we can be more profitable as a market maker.    I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per  trade volume of 30,000 BBL. I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades  by factor of 3.  Almost in all cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked Change for  dollar amount change in millions.  Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

__label__Save	Re: CA for Henwood engagement Stinson,  Attached please find a draft Consulting Agreement for use with Henwood.    You will want to review it before you send it to Henwood.  Please see Section  6 in particular.  Also, I put in that arbitration will be in Houston and  Texas law will apply.  We could move that to New York, with New York law if  that is better for Henwood.  If pressed, we could make it Singapore or U.K.  law, with arb in Singapore.  but any other law, including Australian law,  would mean we would need to get this contract reviewed by foreign counsel--so  I strongly urge you to argue for Texas or NY law (no other state, please).  I tried to make this Agreement reflect the terms in Henwoods proposal, and  believe I succeeded.  Our form has some additional terms not contained in  their Proposal, as well as FCPA boilerplate (ie., the Business Conduct and  Drug Policy language).  Also, I just want to point out that this Agreement  allows them to subcontract the work--but only with our written agreement.   Under their Proposal, the subcontractor costs will be charged to us at cost  plus 15%--so you might not want to do it.  Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

__label__Save	Energy: Oil Drilling: SURVEY FINDS PRODUCERS PLAN TO SPEND MORE THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN ... SURVEY FINDS PRODUCERS PLAN TO SPEND MORE THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN 2000       06/19/2000   Petroleum Finance Week   (c) 2000 Phillips Business Information, Inc.    Oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration and  production expenditures by more than they anticipated  at the beginning of the year, Lehman Brothers Inc. found in a mid-year  update of its annual E&P survey. The 326 companies  we surveyed are planning on an 18.2 percent increase, versus a 10.2 percent  rise budgeted in December, said James D.  Crandell, who follows oil services and drilling for the New York investment  banker.   He emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in Lehmans survey reflects  increases in budgets for 2000 and not  underspending of budgets during 1999. Among the companies that were  included in our December 1999 and May 2000  surveys, global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated  to have been spent during 1999 in December. It  also indicates that nearly $6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide  exploration budgets since December, Crandell said.   The surveys respondents said that they planned to increase U.S. E&P  expenditures by 17.6 percent, up from 15.9 percent  earlier in the year. Crandell said that the greater increase was driven  almost entirely by independent producers. In our survey,  227 independents indicated E&P spending growth in 2000 of 26.1 percent  versus a 22.9 percent increase budgeted for the  year in December, he indicated. Some 40 percent of the independents we  surveyed have increased their U.S. E&P budgets,  while about 23 percent plan on spending less than what they indicated last  December. Higher natural gas prices and increased  cash flow are the main drivers behind this.   Crandell said that Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: APC), Apache Corp. (NYSE:  APA), BHP Petroleum, H.S. Resources Inc.  (NYSE: HSE), McMoRan Exploration Co. (NYSE: RAN), MDU Resources Group Inc.  (NYSE: MDU), Mitchell Energy and  Development Corp. (NYSE: MND.A and MND.B), Santa Fe Snyder Corp. (NYSE:  SFS), Stone Energy Corp. (NYSE: SGY) and  Titan Exploration Inc. - now Pure Resources Inc. (NYSE: PRS) - were among  the larger independents to make the most  significant upward revisions. The ones that significantly reduced planned  U.S. E&P outlays for the year included Barrett  Resources Corp. (NYSE: BRR), Belco Oil and Gas Corp. (NYSE: BOG), Burlington  Resources Inc. (NYSE: BR), Coastal Corp.  (NYSE: CGP), Forcenergy Inc. (NYSE: FEN), Houston Exploration Co. (NYSE:  HEX), Kerr-McGee Corp. (NYSE: KMG), Mariner  Energy Corp. and Williams Production Co.   The survey found that major oil companies plan about the same percentage  gain in their 2000 U.S. E&P expenditures (8.8  percent) at midyear as they did at the beginning of the year (8.4 percent).  Among the 14 companies in this category, 31  percent made meaningful increases in their 2000 E&P spending estimates  during the first six months, including Amerada Hess  Corp. (NYSE: AHC), Conoco Inc. (NYSE: COC.A and COC.B), Occidental Petroleum  Corp. (NYSE: OXY)and Total Fina Elf S.A.  (NYSE: TOT). Another 19 percent - including ENI SpA (NYSE: E), Royal  Dutch/Shell (NYSE: RDP and STT) and Texaco Inc.  (NYSE: TX) - scaled back their domestic spending estimates, while the  remaining 50 percent of the majors in the survey  remained the same.   The increase in Canada... is nothing short of staggering...   The increase in Canada indicated by the 85 companies in our survey is  nothing short of staggering, Crandell continued. Of  the 85 companies that he contacted, 44.7 percent budgeted higher  expenditures for 2000 than for 1999. Compared with  December, 41 percent of them have increased their estimated spending in 2000  by more than 10 percent, while 20 percent  have reduced it by more than 10 percent. The remaining 39 percent have kept  it within 10 percent of what was originally  estimated, Crandell said. Talisman Energy Inc. (NYSE: TLM) led the group  with a huge increase, followed by Anderson  Exploration Ltd. (TSE: AXL), Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. (NYSE: GOU), Murphy  Oil Corp. (NYSE: MUR), Pan Canadian  Petroleum Ltd. (TSE: PCP) and Shell Canada Ltd. (TSE: SHC). Like their U.S.  counterparts, producers above the border raised  their 2000 E&P budgets in response to higher gas prices and increased cash  flow, according to the Lehman analyst.   He said that foreign upstream budgets were an area of surprise: The 14.9  percent gain indicated by the 99 oil and gas  companies that have operations outside the United States and Canada was well  above the 5.7 percent increase for 2000  estimated last December. As in other geographies, there were more companies  that increased budgets than decreased them.  Overall, Crandell said that 33 percent of the surveyed companies raised  their 2000 E&P budgets by more than 10 percent, 43  estimated expenditures in roughly the same range and 24 percent indicated  that they would spend less than originally planned.  He said that the larger increases were driven by some big companies which  materially increased their budgets, including  Texaco, Petroleos Brasileiros S.A., Petroleos Mexicanos S.A. and Repsol YPF  S.A. (NYSE: REP) among the multinationals and  Amerada Hess, Apache, Premier Oil Plc. and Woodside Energy among mid-sized  companies.   Crandell noted that while respondents average price assumptions rose during  2000s first six months (to $22.04 from $19.25  per barrel of crude oil and to $2.58 from $2.38 per thousand cubic feet of  natural gas), they still trail current prices and what  Lehman Brothers estimates for the year ($28 per barrel of crude and $3.30  per Mcf of gas). This suggests a stronger second  half than expected, should companies raise budgets further to reflect the  higher prices, he said.   - Nick Snow in Washington ---------------------- Forwarded by John Peyton/HOU/ECT on 06/19/2000 07:36  PM ---------------------------   djcustomclips@djinteractive.com on 06/19/2000 08:27:26 PM Please respond to nobody@mail1.djnr.com To: 1346@WCTOPICS.djnr.com cc:   Subject: Energy: Oil Drilling: SURVEY FINDS PRODUCERS PLAN TO SPEND MORE THAN  ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN ...

__label__Save	New Update on PPI Model for Inflation Book - Final Version Dear all,  Attached is Anjams reasoning and final version of the UK PPI PLLU model.   The UK Inflation Books main exposure is to two PPI indexes - the PLLU and  the DZCV through year 2010. Both are PPI Output indexes with very comparable  baskets. The only significant difference between the two is the presence of  energy in the PLLU (7.6%). The model in use escalates the two indexes by the  same factors. However, with the energy price fluctuations in recent years  different models for the two indexes would reflect better the nature of their  drivers. Anjam concentrated on the PLLU index first and he will shortly  construct one for the DZCV based on the same methodology, but without the  Brent Crude curve.   The new model achieves the two main objectives of the PPI curve: it is  significantly more robust and stable than the existing one, and it is  considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients. This will result in us  having more confidence in our monthly P&L as well as less fluctuations.   Best regards,  Martina  x34327      Anjam Ahmad 10/03/2000 11:59 To: Martina Angelova/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: New Update on PPI Model for Inflation Book  Dear all,  I followed up on the suggestions of happening babe at the conference call as  follows:-  1) USE LESS DATA  Unfortunately, kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less  robust, in fact dramatically so, and so eliminates the possibility of using  less data.  The model tested was the RPI(month+15) & Deviations from  long-term average for Brent Crude.  The r-squared and F-statistic collapsed  by eliminating the first 12 months of data.  2) DEVIATIONS IN CRUDE VARIABLE  Shifting the crude explanatory variable backwards and forward by 3 and 6  months did not alter the model goodness-of-fit parameters dramatically and so  my suggestion is that we stick with the following model:  PLLU[t] = a.RPI[t] + b.RPI[t+15] + c.BrentCrudeDeviations[t] + Constant  3) TESTING MODEL WITH SINE WAVE  To gauge the response of the model to wildly-varying RPI forward curve, a  sine wave of period 3 years for RPI was input into the PPI model.  The result  was as expected; PPI pre-empts the moves in RPI by about 8 months.  The  magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced.  This shows that if we had  more detail in our RPI forward curve, then the PPI model would reflect those  peaks and humps adequately.    CONCLUSION  I therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates RPI, RPI[t+15]  and deviations of Brent Crude from long-term average.  The new model is  plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old PPI which is  depicted in blue.    Please note that all this analysis only applies to PLLU, and that a separate  study will be needed for the DZCV PPI index.  Regards,  Anjam x35383  ---------------------- Forwarded by Anjam Ahmad/LON/ECT on 09/03/2000 16:52  ---------------------------   Anjam Ahmad 08/03/2000 14:03 To: Martina Angelova/LON/ECT@ECT, Harry Arora/HOU/ECT@ECT, Maureen  Raymond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT, Farouk Lalji/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Trena McFarland/LON/ECT@ECT, Dale Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT, Stinson  Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Leandro  Ibasco/Corp/Enron@Enron   Subject: Update on PPI Model for Inflation Book  Dear all,  We thought it might be useful to incorporate Brent crude as an explanatory  variable for PPI; it was found that deviations of Dated Brent Crude from the  long-term average of $18.80 was the best form of the variable to use (for  predictions the Brent forward curve produced by the Global Products Group is  used).  The three new equations developed were:-  PLLU(t) = a.RPI(t) + b.RPI(t+N) + c.(DatedBrentCrude - 18.8) + constant,  where N is 14,15 or 16 [REDDISH CURVES] r-squared approx 0.49 F-stat approx 32  The chart below shows what our projected PLLU curve would be given this  equation, and also the three best relations from before which were based upon  current and future RPI:  PLLU(t) = a.RPI(t) + b.RPI(t+N) + constant, where N is 14,15 or 16 [GREENISH CURVES] r-squared approx 0.47 F-stat approx 45  COMPARISON OF MODELS As you can see, the two equations differ in the very short-term and very  long-term; the inclusion of deviations of Brent Crude leads to short-term  predictions of 3.0% to 3.2% over the next six months.  The greenish curves  predict PLLU in the range of 2.5% to 2.8% over the next six months.  The curves are then very similar until 2009, when the models including crude  break-away to the upside, relative to the falling RPI curve.  The model based  purely on RPI hugs the RPI curve much more closely in the longer term.  This  is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009  (which we dont).  SUGGESTION What could be useful now is a differently-specified model designed to  forecast only the next 3 months, using auto-regressive or auto-regressive  error terms.  This model would be far more accurate in the near-term, and we  could include this information onto the front of this long-term model.  This  may be useful, despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time  buckets.    BACK-TESTING  All the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data  sample used (based mainly on 1990s new paradigm economy).    Hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele-conference;  your ideas on this would be appreciated.

The model interface will be in Excel Spreadsheet, with most of the inputs (from Enron as well as from the consultant) hiding in an Access data base. The Access data base can be update when needed. The engine will be written in Visual Basis code and be linked to Excel through xll (or dll).

__label__DontSave	Denise Palmer Huggins Interview Seminars/Forums, etc. Sub Group  I met with Denise on December 16th and here is a recap of the discussion relative to our sub group for your information.  Seminars  -Probably no more than 4 per year -Good curriculum makes a significant difference (ie. quality) -Keep at a reasonable cost -Nymex provides seminars which have an audience of 35 to 50 -Denises experience is that people like topics that are practical adding to their skill   base  Forums  - Broader topics than seminars with range of experts - Can range in size from small groups to very large ballroom settings - Marketing makes a big difference in turn out  Conferences  - Generally not as excited about conferences - Shouldnt try one this year - If do one, keep focused on one topic, not multiple tracks - Should be lean and mean, cost effective, 2 days max  Nymex has many contacts and should be able to help on marketing events and perhaps  doing some sponsorship.  Probably should charge for non members for these events but needs to be reasonable.  Small training sessions could be an opportunity.  Denise, hope this is a reasonable summary; please add anything I have left out.

__label__Save	Re: Spreadsheet for George Posey Vince-  Here is an analysis of the fund giving at the church.  First off, it appears from the data that a special appeal for fund giving  was made (from the pulpit?) on April 19, 1998 and April 25, 1999, (perhaps  tied rhetorically into Income Taxes?). Then, by going back and incorporating  obvious dates from the calendars for 1997-1999, the following regression  analysis is made, where each effect is added independently:  giving this Sunday = $4403  + a minor $3 weekly time trend (i.e., multiply by the number of weeks since  Jan. 5, 1997)  + no pure effect from last weeks contributions (i.e., denies first-order  autoregressive effects)  + $2426 if Easter Sunday or the Sunday nearest Christmas  + $9695 if (pastoral appeal) April 19,1998 or April 25,1999  - $340 if the Sunday falls on the weekend of a Monday Federal holiday  - $50 if the Sunday following Thanksgiving  - $73  if a Summer weekend (June 1 thru August 31)  The pure time trend is very small, so an annual projection based on all 3  years data would be for giving to increase only a minor amount ($150) for  2000 assuming a similar appeal for giving is made this April.

__label__Save	Re: natural gas storage item Vince-  Something very interesting about natural gas storage (from the class).  The industry is rapidly adopting what are called Operational Balancing  Agreements, where the pipeline contracts with the producers and LDCs  (public utilities) to handle all imbalances in shipping, namely all  production shortfalls or overages or consumption likewise.  Shippers then  always book what is scheduled to happen, and not what actually happens.   The end result is that storage facillities associated with production regions  are used to smooth out not only weekday-weekend seasonal patterns (the  well-known parking) but to insure issues of wellhead output as well.  Cutting to the chase, storage facilities in producing regions are operated to  insure the integrity of the pipeline system, and estimated marketed  production is likely to be a better estimate of actual flow at the pipelines  receipt meter than is production less local storage.

You will want to review it before you send it to Henwood.  Please see Section  6 in particular.  Also, I put in that arbitration will be in Houston and  Texas law will apply.  We could move that to New York, with New York law if  that is better for Henwood.  If pressed, we could make it Singapore or U.K.  law, with arb in Singapore.  but any other law, including Australian law,  would mean we would need to get this contract reviewed by foreign counsel--so  I strongly urge you to argue for Texas or NY law (no other state, please).  I tried to make this Agreement reflect the terms in Henwoods proposal, and  believe I succeeded.  Our form has some additional terms not contained in  their Proposal, as well as FCPA boilerplate (ie., the Business Conduct and  Drug Policy language).  Also, I just want to point out that this Agreement  allows them to subcontract the work--but only with our written agreement.   Under their Proposal, the subcontractor costs will be charged to us at cost  plus 15%--so you might not want to do it.  Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

__label__Save	Re: Henwood query Hi Karolina,  Yes, it might be more productive to talk on the phone.  Given our time difference, why dont we plan on tomorrow (Friday) 8:00AM PDT, 4:00PM BDT?  My number in the states is 503-464-8430.  Give me your number, too, so that I can call back if I get hung up in a meeting or something.  The situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour, but in constructing the stack, increments of a plant may be scattered throughout the stack, based on their respective incremental heat rates.  (This is why increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model.)  Results for the capacity increments, however, are not available as output; only each plants aggregate values are reported.  I had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a Homer City, NY plant we were studying a few years ago.  Attached is the SQL query you can import into MS ACCESS to do the same thing for you (making appropriate modifications to the year, hour, etc.)  Unfortunately, no Henwood documentation on the output variables existed when I created this query, so I can not really tell you what they represent anymore.  An acquaintance of mine at Entergy and I were lobbying to get Henwood to provide some documentation, so it may be available now.  Lets talk and maybe we can help you out, Michael  >>> Karolina Potter/LON/ECT@ENRON 08/24/00 07:08AM >>>  Michael,   I am an analyst in Paul Meads Continental Power Trading group in London. I am currently working on the project, which requires the use of EMSS, and experience some difficulties interpreting the output results. Steven Leppard from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and consequently the person to contact in case of problems.   I have been running simulations for the Dutch market and was asked to provide the traders with some front-end screen graphs in order to interpret the numerical results. One of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and systems marginal cost, as we only run cost based scenarios. To sort each stations hourly generation I need its marginal cost. To my knowledge though, marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit (TransArea Marginal Units query, Marg_cost unit). Therefore I was sorting the stations according to the cost which I calculated based on the outputs from Station Detail by Hour query. The calculation was as follows:   For each hour, for each generating station:   marginal cost [o/MWh] = (Generation_Cost [o000] * 1000)/Generation [MWh] - VOM_cost [o/MWh]   This I thought would include fuel cost and start up costs. However, a marginal station which I get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a station given in Marginal Station field in TransArea Marginal Units query. I have also looked into TransArea_Data_Hr table and TransArea_Data table but non of the costs there match my results.   Do you happen to know what formula is used to determine Marg_cost and which outputs I should be using to obtain the right results?   It might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone. In this case could you please send me your direct telephone number. I am struggling understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much.

__label__Save	RE: [No Subject] Hi Vince,  This resume looks quite good.  We may wish to talk to him on the phone.  However, now that David Hoog has hired his own actuarial guys (Alex Tartakowski and Larry Markus) from Ace, I am not sure if they require support on the actuarial side.  With Don Black (of Global Risk Markets) leaving Enron, I think the effort to develop power products for the insurance markets is pretty much nonexistent, except for David Hoogs product.  The resume still looks interesting, though.

__label__DontSave	EGM Charges for Avistar Vince,  I have gotten notice from EGM that they want to charge your cost center for the use of a weather research system named Avistar that someone is your group is using.  The plan is to allocate part of the depreciation of the asset to your cost center.

__label__Save	 Vince,    I am writing about a student of mine who is on the job market this year.  When you stopped by my office, about 18 months ago you asked if I had any students that might be appropriate for your group.  Although I didnt at the time, now I do.  This student has excellent technical skills, including an M.S. in Statistics and a Ph.D. in Economics by the end of the current academic year.  His dissertation research is on the investment behavior of Independent Power Producers in the US.  As a result of research assistance he has done for me, he knows the California market very well and is familiar with the other ISOs.  I think he would be an excellent match for you.  The only problem is that he will probably have many other options available.  However, I definitely think hes worth a look. If youd like him to send you a CV, please let me know.  Thanks.

__label__DontSave	Re: smoothing methodology for extracting forward forward volatilities Following up on our discussions I implemented one method for creating forward  forward curve from implied vol curve.  I sorted out 12 forward curves from an original forward vol curve, each of 12  curves corresponding to certain month. Then I fitted each of 12 curves with a function:  y=a+A/power(x+b, beta)  I figured out that when beta is from (0, .5) the above function is suitable  for performing our bootstrapping routine of deriving ff vols from implied, because:  y(x+t) * y(x+t) * (x+t) - y(x) * y(x) * tx> 0                  for all x, t.  (I have to double check on this again. Also when beta>0.5 there are some  combinations of parameters a, A, b, beta for which above equality holds). Even with restriction on beta this class of  functions represents quite a variety of shapes.  Below you see the example of fitting as well as the example of ff vol curve  constructed from implied vol curve for NG.  Ill try this for power as well.  Any comments?

My colleague at Baylor, John  Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on  Friday, February 23 that he is organizing. I am curious whether your schedule  might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as our  dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a national  risk management fraternity. For that matter, would you also possibly be  available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate students on  the previous day (Thursday, February 22)? What I have in mind is a  presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU  classes.   Thank you for your consideration of this request. I am looking forward to  seeing you once again.   Sincerely,  Jim Garven  _________________________________________ James R.

__label__DontSave	MSCF Advisory Board Dear Dr. Kaminski:  Following this e-mail is a summary of the recent meeting of the Advisory Board of the Carnegie Mellon Masters program in Computational Finance. We would appreciate hearing your views on the subjects discussed.  Best wishes, Steve  -- Steven E. Shreve Department of Mathematical Sciences Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA  15213-3890  shreve@cmu.edu http://www.math.cmu.edu/users/shreve Direct Telephone: 412-268-8484 Department Telephone: 412-268-2545 Fax: 412-268-6380 -------------------------------------------------------------------- Summary of MSCF Advisory Board Meeting December 12, 2001  Advisory Board Members in attendance:  Ashvin Chhabra First Vice President Director of Financial Strategies and Analytics Merrill Lynch  Joseph Langsam Managing Director Morgan Stanley  Art Mbanefo Managing Director Equity Derivatives and Convertible Trading Credit Suisse First Boston  James Vinci Partner Paloma Partners Management  David Waldman Senior Portfolio Manager and Director Fixed Income Quantitative Research Group Putnam Investments  Carnegie Mellon Faculty in attendance:  Richard Bryant Director M.S. program in Computational Finance  David Heath Hoch Professor of Mathematical Sciences  John Lehoczky Lord Professor of Statistics Dean, College of Humanities and Social Sciences  Steve Shreve Professor of Mathematical Sciences  The three new members of the board, Ashvin Chhabra, Art Mbanefo and David Waldman, were asked to present their perspective on future human resource needs of the industry.  David reported that Putnam relies on both fundamental and quantitative analysis.  In fixed income markets, he noted the shift from treasuries to mortgages and corporate bonds, and pointed out the accompanying rise in the importance of credit risk analysis.  Although Putnam has been a major employer of MSCF students, he noted that increased emphasis in our program on the asset management industry would be welcomed.  He pointed out the need for our students to understand how to translate theory into practice and to communicate to audiences of various backgrounds.  For David, applicants should be able to pass the airport test:  if you are stuck with this guy for half a day in the airport, will it be a reasonably interesting experience.  Art also emphasized the key role of communication skills. He wants people who are very focussed and who can find practical solutions.  He welcomes applicants who have prior accomplishments which show they can be trained and have discipline.  He cited music and athletics as areas in which these traits can be demonstrated.  Ashvin proposed that students should prepare for the elevator test: if you happen to ride the elevator with a managing director, between the sixth floor and the lobby can you explain something to him in a way that he appreciates.  Ashvin believes that MSCF students, and quants in general, must either be able to work on the trading desk or have management skills if they are to survive in the long term.  He expects there to be growth in demand for people who understand technology and business.  He thinks personal finance services will also be an area of growth.  Echoing one of Ashvins points, Joe would be interested in people with the skills to manage IT projects.  Two subjects raised by Rick are whether the MSCF program should specialize, say into energy or asset management, and whether there should be additional courses in subjects such as accounting and corporate finance.  The consensus was that the MSCF program should stay general, within the quantitative finance niche, and should remain highly quantitative rather than tipping toward an MBA.  There was discussion of the desirability of internships.  Joe pointed out that 80% of the Morgan Stanley hiring is from internships.  An internship doesnt have to be for a summer; eight weeks is possible.  Steve observed that we have not in the past had difficulty placing students even though our program does not include an internship and that an internship would lengthen the program beyond 12 months.  Joe said that a longer MSCF program with internships would permit different student cohorts to overlap so new students could learn from those who had interned.  Faculty would also be enriched by students who had interned.

The CalPX is a scheduling coordinator and they submit balanced schedules and bid curves to the CalISO.  The ISO combines the curves from participating SCs (of which I believe Enron is one) and calculates the uncongested and congested prices.  The CalISO prices are available from RDI PowerDat, the Enron LIM database, and a number of other sources.  Recent historical prices are available from the CalISO web site.  I am copying your mail to Tim Hiezenrader, who runs the Westdesk Fundamentals group.  I believe he would know how you might be able to access the more real-time CalISO data that Enron collects.

Merrill Lynch also performed well, with 13 mentions as a top-five firm in the 17 categories, including first places for high-yield telecoms & media, high-yield industrials, and index provider categories. Another outright winner was Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, which topped the high-grade consumer products sector. A full version of the Credit magazine awards is available at www.creditmag.com.  More responses to the proposed Basel capital Accords - Basel II - emerged this week. The Institute of International Finance, the US-based association whose membership includes Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and UBS, said it was concerned that the proposals may result in an excessively conservative and costly capital framework that overestimates the amount of risk on banks balance sheets. Separately, investment managers said Basels move to cover operational risk is flawed.  In Asia, meanwhile, Credit Lyonnais issued what it claims are the first call warrants on a basket of Chinese B shares, following the decision by Chinas securities regulator to allow local Chinese to buy these shares, which previously were only available to international investors.

Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for  him to remain on the floor.  This will need to be delayed until IT number 1  is completed (cataloguing his work). 2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know  our positions and curves next. 3. Remove his security pass, and insist that he is always accompanied when in  the building.  Sharad is to sit with him while he catalogues his work.  IT-type stuff: 1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the  group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more  than a day or two. 2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjams h: drive for weekly intervals  over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has  deleted. 3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjams Notes folders, and provide records  of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  Im worried  about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out. 4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from  Anjams c: drives.  There may be useful info here too. 5. Revoke all internet access, whether via Explorer or Notes mail. 6. Get a record of all files he has printed over the last couple of months.  Vince has OKd this lot, so lets do it ASAP.

__label__DontSave	ALLIANCE FERC BEAT: GENERATORS/POWER MARKETERS FERC     Post-Meeting Memo for October 24, 2001 [IMAGE] GENERATORS/POWER MARKETERS FERC Post-Meeting Memo for October 24,  2001 Highlights At Wednesdays  Commission meeting, generators scored a major victory with = the Commissions  order setting a new interim generator interconnection pol= icy whereby  transmission owners must pay interest to generators for interc= onnection costs  for system upgrades needed to interconnect. Commissioner M= assey, although  supporting the order only on an interim basis, said that = if the generator is  going to used as a bank, it should be paid interest. = Chairman Wood continues to  be uncomfortable with generators being the ban= k. The remainder of the  meeting focused on establishing processes for continu= ed development of RTOs.  Within that framework, the Commissioners discussed=  the status of the Southeast,  Northeast and Midwest RTOs. Chairman Wood, a= lthough joking of the less than  pleasant comments made by the Chairman of = the Maryland Public Service  Commission, Catherine Riley, and many other st= ate commissioners at last weeks  RTO Conference, acknowledged that the FER= C took heed to the state commissions  concerns and will involve state comm= issions in the decision-making process and  formation of the RTOs going for= ward. To back that up, Commissioner Brownell  proposed the creation of a r= egional panel consisting of state commissions and  FERC staff. This new pa= nel will offer a forum for all regulatory bodies to  provide input in the R= TO process. Commissioner Brownells proposal was supported  by all three co= mmissioners, although Commissioner Massey expressed a little  reservation.=  It seems that the Commissioner is taking steps in that  direction by conven= ing the Western Infrastructure Adequacy Conference to be held  during the W= estern Governors Association Meeting in Seattle, WA on November 2.  This c= onference, too, was aimed at strengthening relationships with the states  a= nd involving them in the decision-making process. In addition, the  Commission extends bid caps for the ISO NE and NY ISO mar= kets, addresses the  issue of costs responsibility for interconnections and=  allows virtual bidding in  the NY ISO real-time market. These and other proceedings are  reported below. If you would like copies o= f any orders, please contact us.  Commission Discussion  FERC Orders Transmission Providers to Pay Interest to  Generators for Syste= m Upgrades It is clear that the Commission is  taking a serious look at the current in= terconnection policies and is not afraid  to revisit earlier FERC policy to=  make sure that they get it right. In a  dramatic move, FERC changed policy=  course and ordered on rehearing that Indiana  Michigan Power Company pay D= PL Energy, Inc. interest on the transmission credits  it will receive from = Indiana to repay it for interconnection costs associated  with system upgra= des of facilities. Chairman Wood believes that the  transmission owner should both construct = and take responsibility for getting  transmission built. Wood went on to s= ay that generators should do what they do  best ...and not be the bank.=  Commissioner Massey tried to stress that  his support of this order is only=  on an interim basis:  My long-term view has  not yet been formulated... I=  have an open mind about how to price  interconnection costs. However, Mas= sey supported this order because he believed  that  if a generator is goin= g to be used as a bank, it should be paid  interest. Commissioner Breathitt, on the other hand, was the lone  dissenter on this = order. Commissioner Breathitt called this item for discussion  in conjuncti= on with six other interconnection-related proceedings being  considered on = this agenda (E-7;E-10;E-12;E-17; and E-17). This policy shift is  to be app= lied prospectively. In support of her dissent, Breathitt said that she  wa= s not convinced that this order adequately counters the July order which  d= enied rehearing on this very issue. Commissioner Breathitt also stated that=  she  believed it premature to address interconnection issues and cost resp= onsibility  in light of the Commissions earlier announcement that it will = issue an ANOPR on  generator interconnection procedures and costs allocatio= n issues.  American Electric Power ER01-2163-001  FERC To Establish Regional Panels to Facilitate RTO  Formation At the request of Commissioner Brownell, FERC will  establish regional pane= ls to help facilitate information exchange and  collaboration between FERC = and the state commissions. This decision is a direct  result of the Commiss= ion responding to comments voiced by many state commissions  at last weeks=  RTO Boot Camp. It was clear that the state commissions have  felt like t= hey have been left out of the RTO debate and process. So to remedy  that go= ing forward, FERC has recommended the creation of this regional panel  stru= cture. The goal of this regional panel is to strengthen relationships with =  the states, help FERC with problem-solving, and bring more efficiency to t= his  RTO process. The Commissioners have recommended that this newly create= d  structure within FERC have a dedicated staff and serve as sort of a one= -stop  shop for states to retrieve and exchange information with FERC.  Chairman Wood expressed his support for this initiative and thanked  Commis= sioner Brownell for her vision. Wood also spelled out what he sees as the  = duties of this regional panel: (1) setting up RTOs; (2) addressing transmis= sion  cost and infrastructure issues; (3) devise demand-side response mecha= nisms; (4)  help develop market monitoring and market mitigation programs; = and (5) consider  best use of distributed generation. Chairman Wood said = that he would like this  panel to look at the use of distributed generatio= n on his behalf. Although  conceding that distributed generation looks mo= re like a retail issue, Chairman  Wood went on to say that he and the Comm= issioners would do everything it could  to help assist the states in that p= rocess. Even though Commissioner  Massey supported the order, he did, however, voic= e his frustration over the  continuous use of conferences and other forums = aimed at developing regional  transmission organizations that have yet to y= ield the desired result: It is my  belief that we have had a lot of proces= s.. if we need more we ought to structure  it so to get to the end game.=  ALJs Discuss RTO Mediation  Reports and Recommendations Southeast RTO Mediation  The Commission heard presentations by staff and both the  Administrative La= w Judge presiding over the Southeast and Northeast RTO  meditations. FERC s= taff signaled the audience that governance is where this  discussion will = focus. Identifying the unique nature of this mediation process,  Judge Bob= bi Mc Cartney viewed this as a new approach to mediation in which she  no= w terms as a market-based mediation approach. In Judge McCartneys summar= y  of her Southeast mediation report, she recommended that out of the two  = governance models that rose from the Southeast RTO Meditations, the  Collab= orative Governance Model represented the most fully-developed model.  Jud= ge McCartney went so far as to highlight several components of the  GridFlo= rida RTO model: It [GridFlorida] has a nicely prepared for-profit  Transco=  model. Interestingly, FERC staff, in its presentation, stated  that both models sa= tisfied compliance with Order 2000. However, upon questioning  by Commissio= ner Massey, staff conceded that the alternate Independent System  Administ= rator (ISA) model may NOT fully comply with Order 2000 and may need  addit= ional work to bring it in compliance. Apparently wearing two hats, Judge  M= cCartneys mediation advisor, Chairman Herb Tate, expressed his preference = for  the ISA model. He stated that public power entities and states may be = more  comfortable with this model because of its similarity to the Indepe= ndent  System Operator (ISO) model currently in place in the Northeast. Both  Judge McCartney and Chairman Tate called on the Commission to take th= is report  and build from it. Judge McCartney made it very clear that the f= indings were  limited to the narrow scope she was asked to address. Judge M= cCartney only  looked at the filings made in the Southeast RTO dockets and = made no comparisons  to other regions RTO proposals. Because of that limit= ation, Judge McCartney and  Chairman Tate asked the Commission to do what t= hey did not have an opportunity  to. Ultimately, the Commissioners were very impressed by the results of  the So= utheast RTO meditations, but recognized that much more needs to be  explore= d and resolved:(1) who does transmission planning; (2) how do you  preserve=  the low-cost energy while restructuring the wholesale market?; and (3)  sh= ould sub-regional RTOs still be allowed to continue developing knowing that=   they will be superseded by the creation of a supra regional RTO?  (EX02-2= ; RT01-100 GridSouth; RT01-34 Southwest Power Pool; RT01-75  Entergy Servic= es; RT01-77 Southern Company Services)  Northeast RTO  Mediation Discussions on the Northeast RTO Meditations went  very much like the South= east. Judge Peter Young summarized his findings from the  Northeast mediati= on with assistance by his mediation advisor via telephone, Joe  Garcia. The=  Northeast mediation did not concentrate on substantive issues and  structu= res, instead it concentrated on process and timelines. The meditations  yie= lded three options stakeholders offered for consideration: Option I-M; Opti= on  2-M; and Option 3-M. Judge Young expressed his favor with Option I-M. H= owever,  again, the advisors and Judges were split on the appropriate model=  to use going  forward. Joe Garcia recommended to the FERC the use of the 3= -M Option, since it  garnered the most broad based support from industry = mediation participants.  Without committing to one model or the other, Chairman Wood did,  however, = state that Option 2 has some attractiveness because of the of the  shorte= ned time frame for implementation. (EX02-1-000; RT01-99 PJM; RT01-98  PJM-W= est; New York ISO RT01-95) Midwest RTO Developments  The Midwest RTO discussions took a different approach beginning  with a sta= ff presentation that highlighted the status of both the Alliance RTO  and t= he Midwest RTOs. From the FERC staff presentation, it seemed as if the  sta= ff portrayed the Midwest ISO as the more progressive of the two RTOs before=   them. Of particular note, Commissioner Breathitt pointed out that Southwe= st  Power Pool had announced its plan to merge with the Midwest ISO, which = could  address Commissions concern that its scope was too small. Looking t= o gain more  intelligence on the announced proposed merger of MISO and SPP,=  the Commissioners  asked Jim Torgenson of MISO to join the panel and answe= r staff questions. The  Commissioners were very concerned with the possibil= ity of seams between the two  areas,( i.e. Midwest ISO and SPP). Mr. Torgen= son quieted those concerns by  telling the Commission that there will be n= o seams... they will function as  one. Under the new proposed structure,=  Jim Torgeson will become CEO of the  newly created and named structure and=  Nick Brown will assume the position of COO  for the new structure. In addi= tion, the Midwest ISO/SPP RTO will seat an  entirely new independent 11 per= son board. Representatives from the  Alliance RTO were not given the same opportunity = to update the Commissioners on  their RTO progress. The Commissioners only = had the staff presentation  summarizing what the Alliance had filed in its = most recent status report  afforded to them. In the presentation, staff not= ed that the Alliance RTO would  not be operational by the December 15 RTO s= tart-up date, but that the Midwest  ISO intended to be. Much of the Midwest discussion centered around the  viability of stand-alo= ne transcos and for-profit transcos within the RTO  structure. Commissione= r Breathitt stated that she hope(s) to see a stand-alone  transmission com= pany. she went on to say that with regards to Transcos, maybe  it is a ti= me that has not yet come. With so much uncertainty surrounding the  Midwes= t and other regions, Commissioner Brownell instructed the Commission no to =  allow these models to be exposed in the market while we [FERC] tincker. =  Commissioner Massey made a statement along the same lines asking for the  = Commission to consider what functions do investors need to invest in RTOs=  that  could make the investments more appealing. It is conceivable that th= is  uncertainty in the market surrounding the creation of RTOs, both for-pr= ofit and  not-for-profit could deter much needed investment in these models= .  (EX02-3; RT01-87 Midwest ISO/Alliance; EL01-80 National Grid USA) -  The message the Commissioners got across at Wednesdays  meeting is that it=  will attempt to give people certainty by proceeding in a  manner that will=  involve the necessary parties to bring RTOs into fruition. (1)  perform an=  updated cost-benefit analysis of creating RTOs; (20 issue a NOPR on  RTOs = that spell out what the Commission is looking for compliance; (3) issue an =  interconnection ANOPR to resolve a huge outstanding issue that could impac= t  functionality of RTOs; (4) create regional councils to facilitate collab= oration  between states and FERC; and (5) issue a NOPR on Open Access Tarif= fs to guide  the industry in fashioning tariffs. Discussion of Western  Infrastructure Adequacy Conference AD01-2 The staff started off the  presentation by stating that it views this confe= rence as a fact-finding  mission. Staff proceeded to lay out three questi= ons the FERC will attempt to  answer through this conference: (1) Is curren= t infrastructure adequate?; (2)  What are the infrastructure needs in the W= est?; and (3) What factors are  inhibiting adequate investment in infrastru= cture? In addition to those  questions, staff is looking to address offsets=  of those larger contextual  questions: (a) what is the outlook for populat= ion and growth of demand in the  West; (b) Why isnt needed infrastructure = being built? what are the barriers?  (c) What can FERC and the states do to=  increase investment in the West? Chairman  Wood ended the discussion by st= ating that what is good for the West is good for  the rest of the country.=  So, we can probably expect FERC to move forward with a  series of regiona= l discussions similar to this conference in the West.  Individual Contested Proceedings  Bid Caps/ Market Mitigation  New York ISO ER01-3001-000  - The Commission granted the NY ISO an extensio= n of its  $1,000 bid cap until which time a Northeast RTO becomes operation= al. The  Commission also directed the NY ISO to file semiannual reports on = the progress  of its efforts to implement programs that could minimize occu= rrence of extreme  prices, e.g. demand-side management programs. In additio= n, as condition for  approval of an extension for the use of the NY ISOs T= emporary Extraordinary  Procedures (TEP), the NY ISO must file within 30 da= ys a more defined set of  procedures for triggering TEP in the market. ISO New England  ER01-3086-000 - The Commission granted the ISO-NE an exten= sion of  its $1,000 bid cap until such time as a Northeast RTO becomes oper= ational.  Morgan Stanley Capital Group v.  NY  ISO EL00-90-000; ER01-3009;ER01-3153-0= 00 - The Commission accepted  the proposal to allow virtual bidding, (i.e. = bidding of non-physical generation  and load) in the NY ISOs real-time mar= ket. The Commission also accepted the  NYISOs revised Market Mitigation Me= asures aimed at addressing potential gaming  or market power that may resul= t from the introduction of virtual bidding.  Generator  Interconnection New York  Independent System Operator, Inc.  ER01-2967-000   The Commission=  addressed the issue of cost responsibility for  interconnection by ruling = that generators may only be assigned costs of System  Upgrade Facilities to=  the extent that these costs are not already in the  Baseline Assessment.=  In addition, siding with generator arguments, the  Commission also ordered=  the NY ISO to delete from its tariff its Material  Impact Standards with= out prejudice. Market  Complaints E-19 San Diego  Gas & Electric Co.  v.   Sellers of Energy EL00-95-034; EL0= 0-98-038 - Order on the CA  ISOs compliance filing proposing a new generat= or outage and maintenance  coordination plan. Dynegy and other protesters a= llege that the CA ISO is  attempting to circumvent FERC and seize control = of the outage monitoring  function that is currently FERC s responsibilit= y and role.

__label__Save	California Update 4/27/01 The following report contains confidential and sensitive information.  Please treat with discretion.  Executive Summary: ? FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives. Politically, Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis; from an economic perspective, he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation ? Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan, most notably its exclusion of out-of-state generators ? June 1st kill clause for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional plan ? California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade, expected $20 billion power bill this summer--economic crisis would force deeper Administration involvement ? QF bid for advance payments from PG&E likely to fail in bankruptcy court ? New generation delays probable because of State/QF squabbling ? Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout deal  1. FERC Fallout The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks like action, but is not.  Rather, it allows the situation in California to continue to develop virtually unabated.  The political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape shouldering the blame.  Once they are politically inoculated,  the Administration can begin to look at regional solutions.  Moreover, the Administration has already made explicit (and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation.  It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan.   2. Something Less than Effective Price Caps  From Daviss point of view, the FERC plan has four major flaws: ? The order applies only to California, not to the rest of the west. Non-California generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California. ? As the order is written, it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling. ? State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system, because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion. ? Even when the price caps kick in, they are based on the cost-plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap.  The generators can also charge above the cap, provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC.  3. Proposal Kill Clause Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless Californias ISO agrees by June 1st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control.  If Davis doesnt sign on to the regional grid by June 1st, then he will have to live with June 2nd headlines blaming him for letting the Bush price caps plan collapse.  4. Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California  could therefore pay as much as $20 billion on power this summer - this is more  than the combined enterprise value of PG&E and SCE.  These sources believe that, because of the severity of the situation, the FERC and/or the  federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for  power.  The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about 90 days. One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long-term power deals.  The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California.  The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture.  The countrys largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months.  5. QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PG&E Meanwhile, on the bankruptcy front, the QFs reportedly  will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGEs  accounts, since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment  for gas. It appears very unlikely that the QFs request will be granted. If the  QFs do not receive advance payment, it is likely that most of the 4,000 mw  of gas-fired QF capacity will remain offline.   6 Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for long-term contracts are  being continually renegotiated, which is likely to mean that the new plants  those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as  anticipated.  7. Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey  Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis  of the MOU for the SCE bailout  plan.  The analysis was done by a  utilities analyst, rather than a lawyer, though it appears to raise a number of  good legal points. For example, one of the elements of the MOU is a non-bypassable charge  on ratepayers that would require  them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid. This is effectively a tax,  since there is no exchange of value  for money, which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly  benefit a private entity.  This makes  the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds, rather than revenue  bonds. According to the constitution, the state cannot be put into debt to  benefit a private company.  For this and other reasons, even if the  Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout, which remains  unlikely, the bailout probably would not  stand a likely constitutional challenge.    8. Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose Long-Term Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to  disclose the details of the long-term power  contracts continues to  distress the other players in the  crisis.  Even if he were to  disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating, it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged, creating an even further delay.

I tried a + b(t+c)(-1) , a standard power law, and as the  accompanying graph shows (for the 12 months), the fits are quite good.             In this case, the ffvols do not become negative (I believe this  corresponds to your 0 beta).     I would have preferred exp(-t) and variants (can explain owing to  mean-reverting vols), but the power law might be a practical alternative  (from an implementation standpoint). Naveen        Tanya Tamarchenko@ECT 11/17/2000 02:59 PM To: Naveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Alex Huang/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vladimir  Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: smoothing methodology for extracting forward forward  volatilities    Following up on our discussions I implemented one method for creating forward  forward curve from implied vol curve.  I sorted out 12 forward curves from an original forward vol curve, each of 12  curves corresponding to certain month. Then I fitted each of 12 curves with a function:  y=a+A/power(x+b, beta)  I figured out that when beta is from (0, .5) the above function is suitable  for performing our bootstrapping routine of deriving ff vols from implied, because:  y(x+t) * y(x+t) * (x+t) - y(x) * y(x) * tx> 0                  for all x, t.  (I have to double check on this again. Also when beta>0.5 there are some  combinations of parameters a, A, b, beta for which above equality holds). Even with restriction on beta this class of  functions represents quite a variety of shapes.  Below you see the example of fitting as well as the example of ff vol curve  constructed from implied vol curve for NG.  Ill try this for power as well.  Any comments?

__label__Save	Henwood Stuff and Thoughts about Valuation Did you guys get this?  I was too interested in the conversation to interrupt with comments about risk/return & valuation of assets for utilities.  I thought I would mention to you, however, that when decisions are quantified, utilities usually use classical decision analysis, i.e., von Neuman utility curves.  If the decision is for unregulated assets or impacts shareholders directly, it is the Presidents curve; if the decision would be covered in rates, it is the customers curves or equivalently the PUCs curve.  I think if I were going to approach valuation in commodities where the assumptions of Black/Scholes do not apply, I would start with the CAPM for large industries in an area, use pro formas to translate this to utility curves for the input commodities, and add the utility curves.  Another issue:  The factor that explains why Enron is lowest bidder is its role in the market.  In the 1930s, Keynes argued that if most market participants with long position were hedgers, futures prices would be higher than spot; if they were speculators or traders, future prices would be lower than spot.  Traders must be compensated for holding the risk; hedgers (including utilities and consumers) are willing to pay a premium for the certainty.  Consequently, Enron traders have bigger bid/ask spreads and lower bid prices.

__label__DontSave	Decision making opportunities Dear Vince:  I hope you have liked the short paper on decision making I sent you a week ago.  It emphasizes the human nature of the process of decision making.  I personally believe that this line of reasoning is systematically neglected by the investment and trading communities.  I think that many of the great traders and investors are very well aware of these limitations of human mind and are making efforts to utilize them.  For example you may encounter similar ideas in the George Soros book The Alchemy of Finance.  I am certain that developing and expertise in this area bears a tremendous potential for improving  Enrons trading operations and will give us an edge with respect  to other trading powerhouses.   Do you think there are desks at Enron that may be interested in developing a system of procedures that leads to improving our trading performance?  I will be extremely interested in working in this field.  By the way I have already gathered many of  the basic pieces of information needed for such an undertaking.  As a beginning I may make an overview of the literature available on decision biases and list as many of them as possible.  Indeed, the mind traps mentioned in the paper are not the only ones.  Later we may discuss with our clients possibilities for quantifying the influence of a selected group of these biases on the performance of our traders.  Still later, a set of questionnaries, a system for keeping traders perceptions prior to every act of decion making, and the result of the decision will be created, etc.    I envision the final product to be a self-educating trading system learning from every single experience, both positive and negative and utilizing the history of the decision maker to her best benefit.  After some transition period, the result should be a more enlightened process of decision making of our traders, stripped as much as possible from the common psychological biases and utilizing human judgment--the very thing which differentiates the good trader from the computer (or the bad trader, for that matter).  I will highly appreciate your opinion on these issues.  Thank you in advance.  Sincerely yours,  Anguel Grigorov, Anguel grigorov@enron.com enron.com Kaminski j.kaminski@enron.com

Feel free to provide the information to Kimberly but,  please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis  we have done in the past.

__label__Save	Re: Henwood query Good talking with you this morning.  By all means, talk to Grant Masson about who else is using the Henwood model within Enron.  Attached are the workbooks I mentioned.  The Details of Jan and July.xls workbook contains the resulting listing from the query I gave you yesterday and you can see how the supply curve was created from that.  The supply curve becomes nonsense at points for reasons I believe are related to reliability commitment constrants, instead of pure economic dispatch, and to the aggregate reporting problem I described in my note yesterday.  The workbook Supply Curve.xls has the simplistic, average supply curve I mentioned, constructed from fuel and VOM costs.  Depending on the question you are trying to answer, it may be an approach to consider.  The Henwood Contacts I had in mind are:  Tao Guo, PhD, Senior Algorithmist  (916-569-0985) * the one I was thinking of Wenxiong Huang, PhD Senior Project Consultant (916-569-0985) Ajit Kulkarni, PhD, Software Product Manager (916-569-0985) * more a trainer, but sharp Cosimo Coscia, Senior Consultant (South Australia) 618-8357-1244 * very resourceful Wade Schauer, Staff Consultant, (916-569-0985) * best for questions about EMSS per se  all have emails, of course.  Template:  tguo@hesinet.com  Also, if you can not get satisfaction, contact Eric Toolson, VP (916-569-0985).  He has a laconic style, but is very focused on customer satisfaction and retention.  And he has the pull to make things happen.  Regards, Michael       >>> Karolina Potter/LON/ECT@ENRON 08/24/00 07:08AM >>>  Michael,   I am an analyst in Paul Meads Continental Power Trading group in London. I am currently working on the project, which requires the use of EMSS, and experience some difficulties interpreting the output results. Steven Leppard from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and consequently the person to contact in case of problems.   I have been running simulations for the Dutch market and was asked to provide the traders with some front-end screen graphs in order to interpret the numerical results. One of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and systems marginal cost, as we only run cost based scenarios. To sort each stations hourly generation I need its marginal cost. To my knowledge though, marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit (TransArea Marginal Units query, Marg_cost unit). Therefore I was sorting the stations according to the cost which I calculated based on the outputs from Station Detail by Hour query. The calculation was as follows:   For each hour, for each generating station:   marginal cost [o/MWh] = (Generation_Cost [o000] * 1000)/Generation [MWh] - VOM_cost [o/MWh]   This I thought would include fuel cost and start up costs. However, a marginal station which I get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a station given in Marginal Station field in TransArea Marginal Units query. I have also looked into TransArea_Data_Hr table and TransArea_Data table but non of the costs there match my results.   Do you happen to know what formula is used to determine Marg_cost and which outputs I should be using to obtain the right results?   It might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone. In this case could you please send me your direct telephone number. I am struggling understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much.

We all tend to use our personal areas (on our H: drives) for  development, and obviously therell be a few years of work in Anjams  directories.  I wouldnt want him to wipe it all out in a fit of bad temper.   Although our IT dept. obviously makes backups, I dont know how long they are  kept for.

__label__Save	Actuarial Course Material Hi Dale,  I just talked to the Actuarial Education Company and found that the combined  material packs (CMPs) are priced per course as follows:-  101 Statistical Modelling: 102 Financial Mathematics 103 Stochastic Modelling 104 Survival Models 105 Actuarial Mathematics 106 Actuarial Mathematics II 107 Economics 108 Finance and Financial Reporting 109 Financial Economics  302 Life insurance 303 General Insurance  Having reviewed, I think the most suitable ones to order are suggested in  blue.  This adds up to o525 for the sub-set in blue; alternatively we can  stick to 103 through 106 for o356 -> I suggest we go for the smaller sub-set  to start off with.

__label__Save	Follow-Up on Captive Generation Vince/Stinson,  Please find below two attachemnts.  The Excell spreadsheet shows some  calculations on the savings from using Dabhol power as against a diesel  genset operating at a higher heat rate.  There is also a differential in  price of diesel, as against naphtha used by the plant.  I have taken data  from the Septemeber bill of DPC.  We do not want to give the actual numbers  to the press, since they ar likely to have a field day with the 6 cent/kWh  energy price of Dabhol that is reflected there.  The seond attachement (Word) has the wordings that I think we can send in to  the press.  Please review the calculations and the note, ad if you find this  satisfactory, please forward to Jeff/s.  I am availabel on mobile if you have questions o clarifications.  The number  (610 MW) for total captive generation in Maharashtra) is taken from Mohan  Gurunaths presentation on this.

__label__DontSave	RE: longitude Chonawee,   Good work. Id like to add a few observations. Regarding your comment about not being able to buy straddles:  Longitude informed us that an upcoming implementation (that is actually in place now but has not been made available so as not to complicate the initial auctions). The new implementation allows packages of digital spreads to be bought and sold as one instrument, resulting in terraced payout functions that approximate true call and put (and presumably collar and straddle) payouts. Even so, the structures will remain largely digital in nature; therefore, they will be rather dirty hedges for traditional calls and puts regardless of how one packages them   As far as getting a bad price, the auctions here are indeed Dutch auctions, but I believe that the limit orders address this issue -- they assure a given payout ratio. Certainly there is no guarantee that any of the amount laid down by a participant will be placed, which is another problem for hedgers. (Then again, a traditional hedger who asks too much for his offsetting transaction is also unlikely to meet with success.)   Lastly, with regard to the last paragraph on publishing tentative prices, it is left up to to the discretion of market maker to decide how much of the auctions internal operations (including tentative prices) is posted, but remember that the auction is intended to last only a few hours at a time, yet again constraining the auctions suitability for hedging (admittedly, there would likely be several auctions throughout the life-cycle of the underlying index).   Joe   -----Original Message----- From:  Supatgiat, Chonawee   Sent: Friday, November 02, 2001 6:37 PM To: Bharati, Rakesh; Shanbhogue, Vasant; Kaminski, Vince J; Hrgovcic, Joseph Subject: longitude  I will be back on Wednesday night. You guys can reach me at my cell phone 713-320-5473.  Attached please find a paper I wrote earlier (before we discuss with them this afternoon) about the longitude.  (Vince, I already gave you a hardcopy of it earlier.. in case you wants a softcopy)  As Vasant pointed out, it looks like they already did the real-time tentative prices posting in their system. So now hedgers can participate in the auctions. I still feel that the system will attract speculators more.

__label__Save	Option P&L Gentleman:         The ERMS system, as you know, has an excellent capability for  decomposing option P&L into the following components:  new deals curve shift gamma vega theta rho drift 2nd order adjustments  What i dont understand is the gamma component which is reported in dollars.   The unit of measure suggests that incremental changes in a contract position  is being associated with specific prices.  These prices are the effective buy  or sell prices associated with the dynamic delta position.    Stated differently, the standard taylor expansion has incorporated a price  variable in such a way as to convert the unit of measure from gammas  standard contract count to total gamma dolalrs.  This is something I dont  understand.  To date, inquiries to the risk management accounting group has  further revealed that the gamma component of P&L is not well understood.    This is what concerns me: Bridgeline has 2 books with option exposures (NYMEX  and Gas Daily).  Both books dynamically hedged its positions during  yesterdays large price move and, through anticipitory hedging in advance or  during the large price move, secured sufficient coverage to neutralize  expected changes in delta.  However, our P&L from our underlying position did  not offset our gamma P&L.  Consequently, I have to ask WHY?  Im hoping that a  brief look at the why gamma dollars are calculated may reveal something which  will better guide our hedging decisions.

__label__DontSave	Risk Assessment and Portfolio Optimisation for Oil and Gas Dear Vince,  Risk Assessment and Porfolio Optimisation for Oil and Gas, 23rd-24th October, Holiday Inn, Victoria, London  I am producing the above conference and have been speaking with both Ron Bain from Anadarko Petroleum and Soussan Faiz from Texaco who recommended that I contact you. I understand that you have a wealth of experience in real options and that this is an area that Enron is extremely committed to. I would love to invite you to come along and speak as I think that you would make a vital addition to the programme. Your colleague Shirley recommended that I email some details over first of all - I hope you dont mind.  I have drawn up a draft programme (attached below) based on my research, but please do bear in mind that this is very much a developing programme and if you have any comments Id really like to hear them. Also if you feel that you would like to present an area that I have not covered in the programme or would like me to rewrite a session I would be more than happy to do so.  I know that you are extremely busy and must get approached regularly to speak at conferences, however I really do believe that this will be a fantastic opportunity to publicise Enron as a leader across Europe. We will be marketing this conference to over 40,000 targeted individuals, including a direct mail of at least 25,000 and in addition an online and press campaign.  We will be looking to work with leading industry press such as Petroleum Review, Oil and Gas Journal, Offshore Magazine and Harts E&P and can also undertake mailings for our speakers and sponsors to their contacts and clients.  Just to let you know of my deadlines, I am working to a very tight deadline and will need confirmation by Thursday 14th June if you are interested in getting more involved in this programme.  I appreciate that this is very short notice, but at this stage I would need very little from you.  You would simply need to choose an appropriate session or I can adapt a short abstract for you and I can co-ordinate with your assistant to get a biography for the brochure.  I look forward to hearing from you soon and sincerely hope that you can make it.

From:  Stephen Bennett @ ENRON                           04/25/2001 04:05 AM    To: Jose Marquez/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mike A Roberts/HOU/ECT cc: Tony Hamilton/EU/Enron@Enron  Subject: Softs (Ag) Support  Hi Guys,  I thought I would quickly update you on a few meetings weve had with the ag  folks here over the past 2 days.  They are extremely interested in weather  support and appear to be our most enthusiastic customer group to date.  A  summary:  1) They are interested in Cocoa, Coffee and Sugar.  Specifically:  Brazil:  Londrina, Bauru, Lavras   (All WMOs available in Accuweather)  Vietnam:  Kentum, Dalat (No data immediately evident)  Ivory Coast:  Man, Gagnoa (WMOs in Accuwx)  Indonesia:  Sumatra-Kotubumi, Sulawesi-Dolo (No data immediately evident)  2) They are specifically interested in event spikes - extreme temperature,  precipitation or wind.  They are also interested in any trend information we  can devise.  Links between ENSO or other large scale oscillations that could  have long range effects.  Tony has already given their group a 101 course on  ENSO and its impacts on these areas.  3) They would eventually like daily AM briefings - along with a daily product  related to their market (ie precip/temp graphs etc)  4) They do not begin actually trading for another 6 to 8 weeks - so we have  some time to experiment with the type of support that fits them best.  Tony and I agree that we would like to brainstorm this a bit with you guys to  see what exactly can be produced daily - as efficiently as possible.  We  should be able to add any lat/long points we want to the list of  international cities streaming through from the MRF/AVN/ECMWF from EarthSat.   The problems here would be the models problems handling tropical weather  along with specific local effects - especially in Indonesia.  Lets talk about this at some point and get our thoughts together.  Steve Mike A Roberts mike.roberts@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com 
__label__DontSave	Natural Gas Origination Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:  Producer/Wellhead Group  The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.  Strategic Asset  Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.  Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.     There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond.   Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.  Louise & John Enron Americas - Office of the Chairman@ENRON no.address@enron.com enron.com

Hi Karin...  I hope you had a splendid holiday!  I wanted to thank you for getting Tony  and I set up here last week.  We seem to have established a steady daily  routine and are supporting several different trading groups in London as well  as continuing our daily support of traders in Houston.  Weve gotten far more  requests for information than we expected, so as a result I will be remaining  in London a little longer than originally expected.  As of now - Im not sure  exactly when Ill be going back to Houston - but Vince has let me know that I  will remain here as long as necessary to ensure adequate daily weather  support for the London traders.    To that end - I think I will need one additional piece of software installed  on the machine that I will be using on a regular basis.  Could I please get  Microsoft FrontPage installed as soon as we can get it?    That leads to the second issue of desks.  I know that space is a premium here  - and I understand that I may need to move around some as a result.  I  certainly want keep things as simple as possible for everyone - but I also  wanted to make sure that you know that there are certain applications that  are essential for the daily trader support in London and Houston.  As such,  if I move, we will need to make sure that these applications are available  from the beginning of the day (we start about 0600).  The applications are:  1)  Adobe Acrobat - Full Version 2) AccuWeather For Windows - (This is something I will need to install) 3) Microsoft Front Page 4) Terminal Server 5) The full MS Office software package  One idea would be to have a PC move with me - that way we would not need to  reinstall this software which could cause problems with the daily support  routine.  Thanks again for all of your help.  I will let you know - once I know - how  long I will be here.  I should hear something from Vince over the next few  days giving me an idea.

__label__Save	Option hedging for EES Eugene,  Bob and I had a discussion about your question you raised yesterday.  For an option writer, he has the obligation to deliver, so he hedges it with  the underlying by adjesting delta positions.  The hedging cost, theoretically, should be equal to the fair value of the option premium.   On the other hand, for the option holder, he has no obligation, by delta  heging, he would pay double for the option, with no upside.  So he should not hedge  it at all.  If the option holder wants to protect the time value of the option, he should  sell  the option to the market or some equivalent options to create a theta-neutral  portfolio. This may require trading in both the orginal and the equivalent option  underlyings.    Our question to you, if the call options you mentioned are embedded in the  EES  contracts, say fixed price sale contracts, What makes it possible to just  separate those options and sell them to the market to retain the full values of the options ?  We  conjecture that these  options are meant to hedge the original contract. By selling those options  you eliminate the upside of the  original contract.  Give one of us a call if you want to discuss this further.

__label__DontSave	Factor Loadings Process As an FYI for those not already in the loop, new factors for VaR have not been implemented since some time in April, and it seems the process of administering them is foggy.  So here is an outline of the R&R and required technology to support the administration of factor loadings:       Broadly, I have assumed that Global Risk Ops can run the process. However, exceptions can take one of two forms:  Large jumps in VaR due to bona fide changes in correlations; Pathologies in the matrix construct supporting factors;  For either, tools are required for users to examine the exceptions and make changes as necessary (generally Global ops in the former case and RAC/Research in the latter).  Note that the IT Development group has no part in this business process beyond building the tools.  Lets use this as the starting point to develop a business model that makes this work.

__label__Save	Re: Choosing the Riskfree Rate Dear all,  I completeley agree with Ben that Treasuries are the most liquid and reliable  benchmarks. I also think that FMAs have their own advantages and  disadvantages.  However, it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using LIBOR  as benchmark - at least to price anything related to Capital Markets (for  example, credit default swaps) . Our prices will always be different from  that on Capital Markets if we use benchmarks different from the Market.  As a half-way solution we can have different benchmarks - for example, use  anything, that we decide is closest to risk-free, to value products  significantly different from that priced on Capital markets,and LIBOR for  everything priced on Capital Markets .   We can adjust by manipulating other coefficients (event, liquidity,  recovery) for our purposes, but it looks like benchmark should be LIBOR.  To avoid negative default probabilites (for highly rated reference entities)  we can add cost fo repo and haircuts (as all bankers do).  Let us continue our discussion on this.

My preliminary conclusions  are as follows:  Recent turmoil in the Treasury market mostly hit 10 and 30-year bonds. Treasuries are still the most liquid curve, and that used by banks for  benchmarking risky debt. There is a considerable a liquidity/scarcity premium inherent within the  corporate-Treasury spread, which we are not taking into account. More  accurate measurement of this premium should allow us to calculate bankruptcy  prices based on Treasuries, which are consistent with the market.  All further comments are welcome of course.

__label__Save	 Folks,  Attached is a conservative (and fairly rough) estimate of the size of the  petrochemicals and refining market that is potentially exposed to prolonged  drought in southern Texas which could result in extremely low riverflows and  possible curtailed production.   The total annual revenue generated by these  assets is no less than $20B and could be substantially higher as the  estimated capacity on some of these facilties is likely understated and other  facilties not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable.  Note that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial  complexes from Houston northward and eastward as they are much less likely to  experience such a drought-induced interruption.  The only facilties  identified thus far lie on or near the following rivers: Brazos, Colorado,  Navidad, Guadalupe, and Nueces.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments as we work to determine  whether or not a low riverflow insurance product is viable.

__label__DontSave	Gas & PoweRisk 2001 Conference, November Dear Speaker at Gas & PoweRisk  2001!   I just wanted to give you a little update  on the developments of the preparations for the conference in November  in Paris. We have now just launched the second round of marketing for the event,  and bookings are coming in very nicely - it promises to be another exciting  conference, and even bigger and better than last years!   For those who have not yet done so, I would like to  remind you of the possibility to send us the names of contacts  that you would like to get informed about your involvement in the  event, and we will then make sure that they receive a conference brochure. To  assure the highest level of confidentiality, you can also send these names to  our third party mailing house instead, and we will guarantee you that we only  use them for this one mailing.   Furthermore, I would like to remind you to book your  hotel room in Paris as soon as possible, should you not have  done so already. The conference hotel is filling up very quickly, and we will  only be able to hold rooms for you until the 28th September - so if you wish to  stay in the conference hotel, please fax the booking form directly to the hotel  as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.   Also please remember that we require a copy of your  presentation by Friday 12th October. Please make sure it gets  to us in time, as it can otherwise not be included in the conference  documentation pack, which in the past has been a constant source of complaints  from our delegates. Thank you for your cooperation!   I will attach the AV form and the marketing form -  please send them back as soon as possible if you have not done  so yet. This should not take more than 5 minutes of your time, but will help us  assure a smooth running on the day.   Thats it for the moment - please contact either me or  my colleague Natasha Woolf should you have any further  questions!   I look forward to seeing you in Paris in a few  weeks time!   Kind Regards,    Angelika Staude Director Gas & PoweRisk  2001   Tel: 0044 207 915 5675 Fax: 0044 207 915 5101www.icbi-uk.com/powerisk   - marketing.doc   - AV form1.doc   - hotelbookingform.doc   - PoweRisk 2001 Angelika Staude <AStaude@iirltd.co.uk>@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-Angelika+20Staude+20+3CAStaude+40iirltd+2Eco+2Euk+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com> astaude@iirltd.co.uk iirltd.co.uk Angelika Staude <AStaude@iirltd.co.uk> astaude@iirltd.co.uk Natasha Woolf <NWoolf@iirltd.co.uk> nwoolf@iirltd.co.uk
__label__DontSave	SEC depostion Bob,  I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition. I decided that I dont really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before the Commission. I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general  advice about the procedures and I shall send you the bill for reimbursement of expenses.   My decision should not be interpreted as a statement about Mr. Levys qualifications. I found him to be an exceptionally competent lawyer. My only regret is that I shall not be given an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience.   You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my right to a counsel.  This was before I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Levy in person.   I am sending you the copy of my fax to the SEC as an attachment to a separate message.

__label__Save	Re: the research lunch I would be very willing to make a presentation to you.  This coming Thursday  unfortunately, I have a sick day scheduled (babies will do this kind of thing  to you) and will not come into the office.  Would it be more practical to make the presentation to a select group of a  few (possibly) interested individuals?  This might give us more shceduling  flexibility and would also seem more appropriate, knowing that what I have is  a set of suggestions for development and no earth-shuttering, live product.

Let her know  what audio-visual materials youll need. Keep in mind that the research group  is now about 40 people, some of whom will be watching the presentation on  video from Portland and from London. The best platform would be to get a  PC-video or PC-screen link-up, so that everyone, including people watching  remotely, can see your computers monitor on a big screen.   The itinerary for the lunch is that we meet at 11:30 and eat lunch and trade  news for the first 30-45 minutes, and then at 12:00 or 12:30 at the latest,  we have a presentation. We try to wrap up by 1:00, so that what we discussed  yesterday should make for a very good presentation in pretty much every way.  From my experience, the audio-visual people need at least an hour advance  warning to get the screens linked up. Let me know if you need any help in  getting you and Jenny the things you need.

Register today at http://nww1.com/go/2184858a.html ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Todays Focus: Concord Communications LiveHealth --------------------------------------------------------------- By Neal Weinberg  For the Reviewmeister, theres nothing like the smell of real- time data in the morning.  Historical data is nice, but its real-time data that gets the blood pumping. So, we took a close look at LiveHealth from Concord Communications. LiveHealth collects real-time data and reports it in an easy-to-understand, comprehensive and timely fashion.  Like any new product, LiveHealth has its pros and cons. It produces excellent reports and supports more than 500 kinds of SNMP-aware devices. But it cant display a networks topology, doesnt offer corrective actions, and wasnt all that easy to install.  LiveHealth starts at $35,000, and is part of Concords suite that includes Network Health, System Health and Application Health modules.  LiveHealth actively polls SNMP-manageable devices, determines their status and condition, and displays the result in real time. LiveHealth can present its reports via a browser-based interface, a server-based console and Adobe Acrobat-based reports. It also can send device status and condition data to network management products such as Hewlett-Packards OpenView.  LiveHealth is complex software. In addition to its sophisticated network monitoring and reporting elements, it comes with the CERN Web server for rendering management data and reports as Web pages, an Open Ingres database engine for storing network device data, and The Santa Cruz Operations XVision PC Xserver, which LiveHealths server console uses to display screen data.  LiveHealths discovery process is quick and accurate. By default, LiveHealth discovers network nodes daily at midnight. At 5-minute intervals (or less often, if you wish), the SNMP polling process probes the condition and status of network devices. LiveHealth understands a plethora of Management Information Bases, and it correctly recognized Lucent and Cisco routers, Samsung and 3Com switches, and the other devices in our test network.  LiveHealth can tell you if a device is performing as its supposed to, but it cant produce graphical maps showing network hierarchies. It stores collected network device information for six weeks in the Open Ingres database.  In its first few days, LiveHealth builds a baseline of normal network behavior. Then, it can detect out-of-the-ordinary events, such as excessively high or low traffic through a router or switch port.  Once LiveHealth detects a problem, a network administrator can choose to monitor the problem device in what Concord calls fast mode. LiveHealth polls the device in frequencies up to twice a minute to help the administrator track the situation.  LiveHealth doesnt offer external alerting functions, such as e-mail or paging, but relies instead on links to third-party programs (such as HPs OpenView) to provide such notifications or take corrective actions.  The strength of the program is reports that show device information by time period, relationship to the organizational structure and type of behavior or exception. We could see devices that had experienced problems, by type of problem, as well as those associated with a particular application.  LiveHealth runs on HP-UX, Solaris, Windows NT and 2000. The documentation is comprehensive, but should include a better roadmap to help users find the various software component discussions in the manuals.  LiveHealths installation was more difficult than we expected, but we found that LiveHealths focus on performance and its extensive reporting are just what the doctor ordered.

__label__DontSave	Work Update Vasant,  A quick update on a number of on-going projects:  1.  JCC Forward Curve/Hedging Strategy (Enron Japan)  h  An update of the historical P&L model was completed and included both commodity and foreign exchange risks.  The standard deviation of historical simulations for single month swaps was significantly reduced with the foreign exchange hedging strategy (two long yen/$ positions and 1 short yen/$ position).    h  Enron Japan, in cooperation with Enron London, developed an alternative hedging strategy based on Brent $ value.  No P&L historical P&L simulations were conducted for the alternative strategy.  h  The original Brent hedge ratios were based on an average of 3 monthly preliminary JCC values offered by METI.  Presumably, the swap will be settled off of the finalized METI JCC price which is released two months after the fact.  Rousseau forwarded those numbers from 1998 to present this morning.  Unfortunately, our model uses historical JCC values going back to August 1991.  Rousseau will hopefully obtain the required historical JCC time series early next week.  h  I havent yet heard about Jeff Shankmans response to the memo that was forwarded on Wednesday.  2.  Ethanol Forward Curve (Enron Global Markets)     h  A meeting was held with Marc de la Roche, Darren Maloney, and Sanjay Patel to discuss the development of a forward curve for ethanol.  A first-cut curve based on NYMEX unleaded gasoline, NYMEX WTI crude, and EIA fuel ethanol inventories was constructed and backtested.  Rolling monthly backtesting (using data from 2000 to 2001) suggested that, on average, the modeled and actual ethanol prices were off only by a few cents for time periods up to 6 months (e.g., 6 month swap).  Unfortunately, the 1 SD value for the historical projections was quite large (+/- $0.30 on a $1.40/gal commodity).    h The changing dynamics of the ethanol market offer the greatest challenge to forward curve construction.  That is, ethanol will likely replace MTBE as the fuel oxygenate of choice over time, which will probably signal a stronger relationship with unleaded gas price.  Unfortunately, the current model uses historical data from 1998 to present which do not necessarily reflect such a strong relationship.  These concerns have been noted to the ethanol guys.  h  The ENE ethanol pricing index has been updated with August, September, and October prices and continues to generally track other industry publication values (e.g., Oxy-fuel news).    h  Marc and Darren are in talks with Petrous as a potential counterparty for an ethanol swap.  h  An ethanol status meeting will be held Wednesday or Thursday of next week with Randy Maffett.  3.  Plastics Forward Curves (Enron Global Markets)  h  Mauricio Mora and I have focused on the development of forward curves for a suite of plastics including propylene, ethylene, polypropylene, HDPE, and LLDPE (see earlier email for details).  h  Initial models for each of these plastics have been completed and will be compared to the current model forward curves and Alan Engbergs expected values.  Alan did forward the most recent curves and personal outlooks to us today.    h  Note that the methologies behind the creation of the old forward curves are not known.  Evidently, one can use various rankings (say 1 to 5 depending on market conditions) to manipulate the model forward curve--I dont know whether regression was involved in these forward curve constructions.  4.  Butadiene-Natural Gasoline Hedge (Enron Energy Services)  h  A request was made to EGM Fundamentals by Trey Comiskey (Industrial Services origination) to develop hedge ratios in natural gasoline to offset a position in butadiene.  The request was forwarded to Research.  h  Stationarity tests and cointegration and regression analyses were conducted on the two series.  The two series could not be cointegrated and the R2 on the differences model was roughly 37%.  Note that there appears to be little month-to-month movement in the historical butadiene series back to 1996.  Analysis of a more recent time series might offer better results--I am also not sure why natural gasoline was selected as the hedge commodity.  h  Trey was contacted to discuss the results of the analysis.  5.  Emissions Technology Investment/Clean Air Solutions (Enron Global Markets)  h  An informal meeting was held with Vince Middleton, Scott Affelt, and Reese Soares (Coal Desk/Clean Air Solutions Group) to discuss a pilot-scale emissions reduction technology evaluation with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).  The group is nearing completion of the testing with potential full-scale implementation of the technology at a number of sites.  h  One of the effluents exiting the system (fly ash) is being discharged into a holding pond.  The holding pond water is exhibiting high levels of nitrogen and the TVA has proposed that treatment of the ponds (9 total) will cost $9 million, half of which will be paid by Enron.   h  The group has asked me to contact the TVA engineers directly to discuss possible treatment options and to see if costs may be further minimized.  No information has yet been forwarded to me.  6.  Textiles Cross-Selling (Enron Energy Services)  h  A meeting was held with Jay Sparling (Industrial Services) and Rodney Derbigny to discuss cross-selling opportunities to the textiles sector.  The initial purpose of the meeting was to discuss the intricacies of Enrons agricultural effort given that cotton is a key feedstock in this industry.  h  The focus of the discussion shifted to cross-selling opportunities and the suite of products currently being offered by Enron.  We discussed most of the EGM commodities (e.g., diesel fuel, weather derivatives, plastics, truck freight capacity) with an eye toward perhaps bringing some of the parties together at some point in the near future.  In the near term, the most likely cross-selling candidate would be diesel fuel swaps for the trucking fleet.  7.  Traffic Volume Analysis (Enron Freight Markets)  h  Pravas Sud continues to work part-time on analyzing the DataPave database traffic studies with a goal of developing some understanding of freight volume throughout a given year.    h  The construction of the dataset using the information sent by SAIC has been extremely difficult.  In conjunction with IT, we have had to reconstruct the data series multiple times.    h  Data for the I-10 corridor from Houston to Los Angeles and the I-5 corridor from Sacramento to Seattle constitute the initial routes to be investigated.  Several testing points in each state are located along the routes and 5-axle and above traffic volume will be evaluated for monthly and daily trends (1998 data only).  8.  Propane Demand Model (Enron Global Markets)   h  Sarah Wooddy has completed the US propane monthly demand model and forwarded the results to EGM Fundamentals for inclusion into a larger model for Lee Jackson.  She has conducted backtesting analysis on the monthly data and also forwarded this information to Fundamentals to give them a sense of model error.    h  Propane demand modeling work will continue to meet the requests of the Weather Research Group.  9.  Heating Oil Demand Model (Enron Global Markets)  h  Shalesh Ganjoo is continuing to work on monthly heating oil demand for the PADD 1 states.  The monthly models for Connecticut and Maine have been completed (note that time series were checked for stationarity prior to modeling).  h  The short-term goal for this work is the completion of monthly demand models for all of PADD 1 by the end of next week.  We concluded that it would be best to finish up the monthly models for the entire PADD before embarking on the daily model analysis.    10.  Pulp and Paper Forward Curves (Enron Industrial Markets)  h  Week-to-week discussions have been held with Maria Theresa Aguilera-Peon (EIM Fundamentals) on pulp and paper forward curves.  She is currently beginning work on a pulp forward curve.

__label__DontSave	Mark Palmer re Andy Fastow Vince:  Ive been on the road for a week and will be in southeast Asia and Australia for the following week. I did, however, get a message from Mark Palmer saying that he thought I should present our stuff on current operations value/future growth value directly to Andy Fastow. I agree this makes sense.  Nevertheless, I think the idea would have greater credibility if you, in addition to Mark, were to express an interest in the framework to Andy. Would you be comfortable doing this? Id just like you to send Andy a message saying that you think the COV/FGV framework is logical and that investors would find it logical as well.  If you can do this, Melissa Jose would then give Andys office a call and try to set up a convenient time for a presentation. Of course, I would be very happy if you could attend that as well. That would also give the two of us an opportunity to explore that article we have been meaning to write!

__label__Save	Re: Generation Earnings Model Michelle, I agree with you that we need to run AT LEAST 500 iterations.  But I did not realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations. Helen and I talked earlier about using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts and run the parts separately on different processors, then aggregate the results. This procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time. Looks like we have to do it this way now.  Buying a more powerful computer helps but  does not solve the problem.   In addition, we might want to re-consider if writing the code in VB is optimal. I was assured at the very beginning that VB runs as fast (if not faster) as C, but some re-assurance from IT group on this issue is helpful.

These recommendations are informed by the fact that I dont feel Anjam has  much to offer his next employer, except what code and data he can remove from  Enron:  HR-type stuff: 1. Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for  him to remain on the floor. 2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know  our positions and curves next.  IT-type stuff: 1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the  group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more  than a day or two. 2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjams h: drive for weekly intervals  over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has  deleted. 3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjams Notes folders, and provide records  of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  Im worried  about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out. 4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from  Anjams c: drives.  There may be useful info here too.

__label__Save	Re: Option P&L Brad,  I was extreamly busy yesterday.  Sorry for answing your question till now.  Although I am not exactly sure how  the system handle gamma, this is what I=  think the system is doing:   Curve shift =3D todays price - yesteradys price  P/L due to curve shift =3D todays market value using todays price curve (= with everything esle the same as yesterdays) - yesterdays market value using=  yesterdays price curve.  So P/L due to curve shift contains both delta and gamma and higher order terms. We then use theoretical gamma (meaning option model gamma: 0.5*gamma * (pri= ce change)2 ) for gamma contribution and?define delta =3D curve shift - theore= tical gamma.??Therefore, the gamma may not be very accurate to explain the = delta change, ?especially when you have big price change due to higher orde= r contribution. ??Let me know your thoughts on this.???Best wishes,??Zimin?= ????????

__label__Save	Re: Trading Algorithms Andy,  Sounds good. One comment: Vasant is swamped with work coordinating several high profile projects.   Bob is very productive and thorough and will get a lot of support internally from other members of the group: this contribution may not be directly visible but it will be still very important.  We appreciate your hands-on involvement. Its always the most important condition of a successful project to have direct and frequent interaction with the customer.

Research will continue working on custom reporting off of EnronOnline data.  2). Research will continue working on market analysis off of EnronOnline data  3). Research will a contribute a resource to the Trading Algorithm effort, presumably one at this point in time. I would prefer it to be Vasant but I am flexible.The Trading Algorithm group will be run by the EnronOnline team with its product reviewed by Research. It is my belief that projects like this require a firm commercial hand in their infancy to make sure they stay on the right track.

__label__Save	Daily Rates - Jackups John:  Claudio put together a spreadsheet for cheking the change on a composed  jackup index against the change on individual categories of jackups and  semis. He did not weighted the index because we think we will benefit from a  simpler index price calculation by taking the straight average.   The results show a good R-square between the general index and individual  jackup categories - on the range of 0.7 - 0.8. Only one category displayed a  poor R-square - about 0.3. For semis of 4tht and 5th generation, however, we  noticed a degradation on the hedge effectiveness - R-squares about 0.2 - 0.3.  You may verify each regression by changing the choice cell (AX2 on Analysis).   Claudio is also starting to analyze how gas and crude past moving averages,  12 month swaps on gas / crude, and rigs utilization explains the daily rates.

__label__DontSave	help finding finance work Dear Vince,  Just to remind you, I will be graduating this May with an MBA from Rice.  My concentration is in finance, but Im also an undergraduate engineer from Cornell University and an IT specialist.  I need help not simply finding a job, but perhaps some suggestions on how I can differentiate myself from my classmates in my job search.  Ive been somewhat frustrated trying to explain why Im more effective than my peers. Mike Roberts even said that I achieved more for the weather group in three months over the Summer than any other MBA achieved in a year.  This was probably due to my technical background and ability to put models into program code quickly and reliably.  I know this is a tough economy, but I just want a chance to do good work and show quick success.  What I cant say in my resume is that Im the best in my class at finance, statistics, and information technology.  However, this combination is also my biggest crutch.  Id like to engage all my skills, but typically, interviewers are only looking for one.  Do you have any leads to big or small companies that might be interested in my skill set?  Im indifferent to moving anywhere in the U.S.  Vince, in any case, I appreciate your time and any suggestions you could offer.  I had a wonderful time working for you, we really had a good team.

__label__Save	Comments Julie,  Sorry for the delay. Here are he comments.  Vince  ************************************  Sorry for long delay in responding. I have a few comments. Most are focused on the third article as here is till time to make modifications.  1.  In the second article, I would mention that the formulation of the mean reversion process represents one of several possible equations that capture the same type of market evolution of prices over time. 2.  One comment that applies to both articles. The problem is how one defines the time series of energy prices. The numbers used for Australian NSW pool prices seem to correspond to chronological prices. One alternative approach is to build different time series for the corresponding time intervals for each day. This would result in different price behavior and estimates of jump. The choice is one of convenience and depends on actual problem under investigation. One could argue that volumes of electricity traded during different time slots represent different economic commodities. Figure 3a (Jump Frequency) has units on the vertical axis that require explanation. Are we talking about an expected number of jumps in the total number of half hourly periods in a year?

I shall  elaborate on my  position and send you a longer message this afternoon (my time).  Vince         Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe    From:  John Bottomley                           06/19/2000 05:55 AM    To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Dale Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Equity investment Fair Value in Turkey  Vince,  John Sherriff recommended that I contact you regarding an interesting (and  potentially contentious) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with  in London.  We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which  is currently seeking to IPO.  The issue we are discussing with RAC is which  discount rate (i.e., risk-free? and if so Turkish or US?) should we use to  value these options  First, some additional information.  Option characteristics: -- 116,000 options (representing 9% of the company) -- Term:  minimum of 3 years but possibly longer -- still being renegotiated -- Strike price:  20% below the upcoming IPO price (either priced in US$ or  Turkish Lire)  We currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $118.75  per option but 34,800 expire on July 15, 2000 with the remainder expiring on  December 15, 2000.  The companys investment bankers (ABN / AMRO Rothchilds)  are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at  $118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $300 million.  Due  to such a large valuation gap, they originally encouraged us to exercise  all of the options by the end of June (IPO target date in late Sept / early  Oct).  Our counter-proposal is to swap instrinsic value for time value by  repricing the options strike higher while extending their term.  We are currently negotiating with RAC the most appropriate discount rate to  use to value the options.  We are arguing that the US risk free is the most  appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the companys  historical senior debt cost (18%) is the more appropriate number to use  (although admit that this is not justifiable -- only a proxy)  A few key points: -- RAC is valuing the options via Crystal Ball simulations such that this to  be negotiated discount rate is used to calculate the PV of the future  options intrinsic value in 3 years  (i.e., for Black-Scholes, a higher discount rate yields a higher value but  the opposite is true using Crystal Ball simulation) -- The model simulates both an IPO / no IPO case and in the case of no IPO we  have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17% return -- The model assigns a 30% illiquidity discount -- In the simulated cases where the options are out-of-the-money, we  obviously do not exercise.  We understand that for Black-Scholes option valuation, one needs to be able  to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and  the risk free in order for the valuation to hold.  And here is where we reach  our difficulty:  since the company doesnt currently trade on a public market  and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities, RAC is arguing  that a US risk free is not appropriate to use.  Our argument is that the  non-IPO scenario, a 30% illiquidity discount and a US$ based option  volatility are already in the factored into the simulation.  As such, we feel  RACs approach is double counting.  If you managed to get through the above, your a patient man!  Ill give you a  call today or tomorrow after youve had a chance to digest the information.

__label__Save	West Power model Lance and I spoke with Tim Heizenrader regarding modeling work and needs for  the West Desk.  The differences in the markets between East and West are, in  Tims opinion, sufficient that he does not need an approach as sophisticated  as the one we are pursuing for ERCOT.  In particular, the termal limits for  which load flows are so useful are not generally binding in the West.  Loop  flows are also not considered a major issue at present.  In summary, it seems that the West is an unlikely customer of any extension  to an ERCOT/East transmission model for the time being.  They have also done  little in this area that would directly relate to our efforts here.

__label__DontSave	Re: GARP 2001 Convention Dear Vince  Thank you for your recent enquiry concerning a complimentary pass to the two-day GARP Convention. Unfortunately, it is not GARPs policy to allow this for a number of reasons: GARP is a not-for-profit organisation, will much lower delegate fees (and still the same overheads) than other conference organizers. GARPs mission is to allow an educational forum for furtherance of financial risk management and an opportunity to allow networking and contact time between financial risk professionals. However, in an attempt to remain at ease with my speakers, I would like to offer a 50% discount off the delegate fee for one of you colleagues in Enron. This will be for the two-day Convention and will include the Gala Awards Evening on 13th February, which had over three financial and risk professionals at GARP 2000.  I trust that this is satisfactory. If you would like to take advantage of this, please fax a completed registration form, along with a brief covering note referring to this e-mail, and I will ensure that our administration depart handle the relevant paper work. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.  I look forward to your response and to meeting you in New York in February (and receiving a copy of your presentation in a few days).

Thus far, GARP 2001 looks set to far exceed our  expectations and GARP 2000. There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001  Convention. Delegate bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As  a result, we are set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention earlier this year. The three workshops and the one-day Asset Management Forum  are also very well received and will probably reach full capacity. I will of  course provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of the  event.  Regarding the event itself, I would like a few  outstanding issues:  1. Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15th December, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in a delegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas and New York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sure you can appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need to be taken into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are required as soon as possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request you bring your presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppy disc or a laptop.  2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of what audio-visual requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection - notably PowerPoint).  3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If you have not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to my colleague, Claire as soon as possible.  If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact me, otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course.  I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February.

__label__DontSave	Housing Data and Stationarity Eugenio,  As a follow-up to our meeting yesterday, a series of evaluations was conducted on the housing starts data to insure that the time series response variable was stationary (recall our brief discussion of results based on non-stationary time series).  Dickey-Fuller and Augmented Dickey-Fuller (accounting for autocorrelation in the error term) unit root tests were used in the evaluation process.  Given the limited number of observations for  certain potentially important explanatory variables (e.g., %population change, etc.), we tested the housing starts variable over 3 historical periods.  The results are provided below:  Period 1:  1959 through 2001 (obs=503)  TEST  TEST STATISTIC  CRITICAL VALUE (p=0.05)      DF   -6.712    -1.95 ADF (5 lags)  -2.436    -1.95 ADF (1 lag)  -4.689    -1.95  Period 2: 1984 through 2001 (obs1)  TEST  TEST STATISTIC  CRITICAL VALUE (p=0.05)  DF   -3.140    -1.95 ADF (5 lags)  -1.158    -1.95 ADF (1 lag)  -2.053    -1.95  Period 3: 1996 through 2001 (obs=62)  TEST  TEST STATISTIC  CRITICAL VALUE (p=0.05) DF   -6.354    -1.95 ADF (5 lags)  -2.100    -1.95 ADF (1 lag)  -3.954    -1.95  **Time series stationary if TEST STATISTIC < CRITICAL VALUE  Based on the results above, the housing starts time series are stationary, with the possible exception of 1984 through 2001 data.  Since you are likely to use the entire data series in an AR framework, the assumption of stationarity holds.  Let us know if you have any further questions.

__label__DontSave	Storage model Tom,  The Lukens storage model is very similar to yours. I got a paper from the lead developer Dr. Hugh Li, explaining in significant details about their model.  Let us compare notes after you read it.  We have both DP approach (mine) and optimization approach (yours). We may combine the advatanges of the two approach into one product, and then we can claim we have the best Storage Model (and sell it if Vince feels like it).  Sounds like a plan ?

__label__DontSave	RE: Job posting Dear Vince,  I was really disappointed when I did not hear from Lee Ferrell after he interviewed me back in May.

__label__Save	a basic idea of price-offer matching clauses Vince-  Here is the basic idea I was alluding to:  Suppose a car dealer promised to match any advertised price. Then his  competitor would feel the need to respond in kind. And so on, until all  dealers advertised they would match any advertised price. Now, consider one  of these dealers decision to perhaps lower his prices. If he does so,  everyone will immediately match his price, so his market share will remain  unchanged, at whatever it was before, but his revenues (and all other dealers  as well) would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction. So, the  dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars.  Now, suppose a limited partnership, where the partners contract to control  who they are in business with, by putting a right of first refusal clause  into the partnerships papers, whereby any partner wishing to sell his  interests must offer the remaining partners the right to match any offer the  partner received from outside for his shares. Now, suppose you are an  outsider, considering doing your due diligence in the thought you might want  to buy into the partnership. You know if your offer is a good one from your  perspective, offering you the prospects of a fair rate of return, the  existing partners will match it, and you will get nothing in the deal but you  will have paid, from your own pocket, for your due diligence. Conversely, if  you offer too much for the shares, then the other partners will not match  your offer and you will then realize you overpaid. In neither case can you  credibly assume you know more about the business than do the current  partners. So, you (basically) dont make an offer.  So, a partners shares  are seriously devalued by his partners having the right to match any offers  he receives for them. The right of first refusal clause precludes  economically efficient rebalancing of portfolios by rendering the shares  (essentially) illiquid.

I used to e-mail Vince Kaminski about the  advice on his article The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity  Derivatives and he had mailed me the copy. I am now modelling the Queensland electricity spot price using Geometric  Brownian Mean Reverting Jump Diffusion Model and have followed your paper  Making the most of mean reversion to estimate the mean reversion speed. I  use Queensland half-hourly price during 13 December, 1998-30 June 2001 giving  about 44,000 price observations.  However, the result from Ordinary Least Squares was not as expected due to  different sign for both slope & intercept. The coefficient and standard  error are as followed: Intercept: -0.3931 (0.0076) Slope: 0.1171 (0.0022) R Square: 0.0585 Therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate as the estimated  slope has the positive sign.

I have looked through  the formulas and do not see inconsistencies, but we are getting significantly  higher Gamma values in out years than in the near months/years.

For a  variety of legal, contractor, and operational reasons, I need to confirm some  of the following requirements as soon as possible so we can proceed:  a)  You need rainfall, snowfall, and temperature measurement from one,  high-accuracy commercially available weather station. b)  You need a daily feed of this data to Enrons weather desk:  Does this  mean one data dump at a set time per day?  Alternatively, will you need to  check the data real-time, perhaps at varying and multiple times during the  day?  c)  We will be installing this station near Sacramento, California:  We will  need to know exactly what areas in/near Sacramento are suitable for the site  of the weather station.  (What again was the name of the town that you  mentioned Mark?)  In the interest of time, I recommend that your weather  expert accompany our landman to select the site, which will allow our landman  to more quickly lease and install the station. d)  You desire to have some independent security measures to deter or detect  tampering. I suggest given the very short time fuse, that we first install  the station and then develop security measures. e)  We will feed the data directly to the Enron weather desk.  Will any other  parties require real-time access to this data?  Please forward responses directly to:  Chris Clark/NA/ENRON and myself.

YOU HAVE ALL THE CODE (C & VBA) THAT MAKES UP THE LIBRARY NOW - PLEASE SEE  PREVIOU E-MAILS  2)Also could you e-mail me documents on the changes you have made to   S:\Research\Exotica\Excel\Exotica.xla  CHANGES ARE DOCUMENTED THROUGH ATERATIONS TO COMMENTS ON INDIVIDUAL SOURCE  CODE FILES AS IS THe CURRENt METHOD IN HOUSTON AND As ADOPTED BY ME IN  LONDON  - VERSION CONTROL OCCURS AT THE INDIVIDUAL FILE LEVEL RATHER THAN  THROUGH SOIURCE SAFE  3)The exotica.xla used in London and exotica.xll used in Houston are quite  different. What regression testing has been done? How do we know if the two versions that we have been using produce the same  results.  I HAVE NOT RECENTLY COMPARED THE XLL FROM HOUSTON WITH OUR XLA - THIS WOULD  BE A USEFUL EXERCISE FOR YOU  4)Judging from the documentation there are quite a few more functions  available on the Houston Exotica like Asian spreads, quantos, digitals etc. Is there any reason why they have  not been implemented in Londons exotica.xla?  MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADES TO LONDON EXOTICA TO ENSURE COMPATABILITY WITH  HOUSTON AND VICE VERSA IS AN ON-GOING PROCESS - INEVITABLY THERE WILL BE SOME  LAG BETWEEN A NEW MODEL BEING IMPLEMENTED IN HOUSTON AND IN LONDON, AS IS THE  CASE WITH ASIAN SPREADS AND DIGITALS.

Eric tells me he had a very productive summer at Enron and was exposed to several ideas that have shaped his research agenda, both in the pricing and trading space and in the telecom one.  I need to support him and a new student I am bringing aboard on this project for this quarter and the academic year, and I would like to see how  we can move ahead with this years funding for this project. I understand that EBS has had some problems, but we are willing to expand our research agenda to match the current needs and foci at EBS or other groups. Eric broughtback from Enron a couple of very interesting research problems that he/we is/are focusing on now.  Please let me know how we can proceed. Im under some pressure by the Department to move ahead with finalizing the research assistanships.  I look forward to see you again at Stanford or Enron.

I observed that there is an opportunity to get in the early steps of  the (oil exploration) energy supply chain - we can get at the key data  driving oil drilling earlier than anyone else by extending into this area of  broadband networking - to build a way to hedge oil and other energy trades.    I asked Adler or Reichardt to present the idea to your team for validation.   Have they contacted you yet?  2) Im converting to consultant - Ive had a great year here but need to get  back north more often (family).

In its current form the analysis is quite simple. A stochasitic (fast or slow, with abritrary periods) is computed from the stocks data (see below for a more detailed description). Next, the stock data searched for Japanese Candlestick patterns (see below).  The actual analysis consists of simulating several years of trading (here ten years). Each is stochastic and candlestick data is examined. If the days candlestick is a hammer and the %k is above a pre-defined value, a buy signal is triggered. Likewise, if the days candlestick is a hanging man and the %k is below a second pre-defined value, a sell signal is triggered. When simulating a buy, a long position of a constant number of shares is opened if long positions already exist or if no positions exist. If there are open short positions, each of these is closed. Likewise, when simulating a sell, a short position of the same constant number of shares is opened if short positions already exist or if no positions exist. If there are open long positions, each of these is closed. When closing a position, the rate-of-return and annualize rate-of-return are calculated. For both long and short positions:                             sale cost - purchase cost                      RoR = -------------------------                                 purchase cost (a better method is needed for shorts)  and,                                                365                                       --------------------                                       Duration of Position           Annualized RoR = (RoR + 1.0)                     - 1.0  Stochastics:             (Todays Close - Lowest Low for kN Periods) %k = ---------------------------------------------------------      Highest High for kN Periods - Lowest Low for kN Periods) %p = Simple Moving Average of %k for pN Periods       (Where the lowest low is chosen from amongst the lows       field and the highest high is chosen from amongst the       high field.)  This is a fast-stochastic. When computing a slow stochastic, %k is replaced with its 3-day Simple Moving Average. %p is then calculated from this value.   Japanese Candlesticks: The application currently searches the data for the Hanging Man and Hammer patterns. A Hanging Man is defined as very short top-shadow, medium body, and long bottom-shadow. The ratios are adjustable. A Hammer is a Hanging Man where the days close is higher than the open.    -- Vince Kaminski vincek@cs.stanford.edu VKaminski@aol.com@ENRON vkaminski@aol.com aol.com Kaminski j.kaminski@enron.com

__label__Save	GPCM Summary 1999 This has been a great year for RBAC and GPCM. During the year we have doubled to 10 the number of GPCM licensees. This means weve also doubled the number of wonderful people weve trained and are supporting. And, I sincerely mean it when I say it has been a real pleasure working with you all. One of the things we stress when we are selling GPCM is that it takes a strong commitment on the part of the licensee, a commitment to find skilled and dedicated people to make optimal use of this sophisticated tool.  And, Im happy to report that we have that quality in the GPCM teams we work with. Next year we have some big challenges.  We will be converting the system from Office 97 to Office 2000 and will also need to make sure it will run in the Windows 2000 environment. We will be adding new flexibility in defining our transportation zone price curves to enable users, especially pipeline users, to test variations of pricing strategies for their impacts on basis and utilization. We will be adding a capability for modeling future FT contracting. We will upgrade our existing Database Comparison program to allow you to select those items you want to have automatically updated in your own databases. We will continue to work with RDI to improve pipeline and storage infrastructure representations, to provide interfaces between GASdat and GPCM, and to give you regular optional updates for your own databases. We are beginning to plan out a new website dedicated to GPCM licensees (and possibly prospects).  We have acquired gpcm.rbac.com and gpcm.net for this purpose. In making these various changes, we look also to you, our existing licensees, for enhancement and improvement ideas.  We are planning to conduct interviews of our licensees during the next 30 - 60 days to find out what you like, but also what you would like to see improved, as well as some new ideas for GPCM.  I would like to thank the following people for their contributions to GPCM during 1999.  o Liam Leahy for his excellent marketing, sales, and planning support o Charles Carr for his quality work on our website and support with subtle Visual Basic programming issues o Richard Berman for thorough research on design tools and skilled Windows programming o Richard McBride for continuing support and development of his EMNET optimization program o Aaron and James Brooks for design and production of the PowerPoint pipeline maps now available in GPCM o Mike Farina and RDI for their continuing improvement of the GPCM data and GASdat database o GPCM users who have found data bugs and reported them to use so that we could get them corrected o GPCM users who have suggested new features which would make GPCM a better product o GPCM users who have given us sales leads during the year o GPCM users who have used GPCM to help their companies make better plans and decisions, which is, after all, the purpose for which it was designed  We hope all of you have a wonderful holiday season and look forward to an even better year 2000.

__label__Save	cost sharing of subscription to Potens Fuel Oil Report All: Ideally we will split this cost evenly among as many P&Ls as need the  report, minimizing everyones cost by sharing a single subscription.  Please tell me whether you can justify sharing the cost and if so, the RC  code & co# for me to allocate your cost share.  Please indicate your choice  of the three cost choices.  Attached note below clarifies Potens proposal on the $10,000/yr subscription. Essentially we have three choices: 1.  for $2700/yr, the standard edition (11 issues, excluding the monthly  special feature article) 2.  for $3800/yr the premium edition, (standard edition PLUS the monthly  special feature article, as in three attached examples) 3. for $10,000/yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for  36 months.  Poten explains that 85% of their subscribers take the premium service.  No  one has ever asked for the $10,000/yr long-term price forecast.  I have an  interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to  others in the corporation. The example copies attached include the following Special Feature articles: 99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean 99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere 99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile One either takes all or none of them for the incremental $1100/yr.  Some may  be useless, others perhaps quite valuable.  Your call.   regards Guy      Axelrod, Larry <LAxelrod@Poten.com> on 02/03/2000 02:43:59 PM    To: Guy Dayvault/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Fuel Share Group <fuelgroup@Poten.com>   Subject: Enron/Fuel Oil Service      Dear Guy,  It was a pleasure speaking to you today.  As discussed, Poten is pleased to offer Enron the following two-part fuel-oil related service:  (1) a one-year subscription to Potens Fuel Oil in World Markets (Premium Edition), and  (2) a forecast of delivered crude prices and fuel oil prices in Northwest Europe (Brent and 1%S FOB fuel oil), the Mediterranean (Bonny Light and 1%S FOB fuel oil), and Singapore (Dubai and HSFO-380 cSt).  The forecasts would be provided four times a year and provide average quarterly price projections over the forward 36-month period. The forecast prices would be accompanied by brief textual commentary.  The forecasts would be issued over the course of the one-year Fuel Oil in World Markets subscription period.  The fee for the two-part service is US$10,000, payable in two equal installments  I look forward to hearing from you.  Best regards,  Larry  L.

Attached below are 3 example copies that include their standard 12 month  price forecasts.  The cost is $3800/yr. As an added service for a total of $10,000/yr, Poten will include a quarterly  update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and FO prices with a brief  justification for their view.  This would include the standard monthly price  forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24  months for Far East, Med and NWE.  (I expect a more descriptive email from  Poten, but I think this is the essence of their custom offer.)  The example copies attached include the following Special Features: 99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean 99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere 99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile These type of features are produced monthly and run a spectrum of subjects  related to fuel oil.  I have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the price  forecast without the considered recommendation of colleagues such as yourself  regarding the utility of such a report.  The best way to show your  recommendation is with money.  If it is not worth any money to anyone else in  ENE, then I have to question its validity and utility to me as well.

__label__DontSave	RE: Scotts concerns about the Public Firm Models Hi Scott,       How are you?  Thanks for your email.   I can appreciate your concerns about the public firm models, but am at a loss for what more I can say that has not already been said.    Recall that during my recent trip to London, we had a conference call with Houston research, you, Bryan, Mike and Eric.  During this conference call Vince, Vasant, Amitava and I pointed out some of the issues with the public firm models and the data used to develop these models.     In addition, after that conference call you, Bryan, Mike, Eric and I had further discussions as to how to sort out the public firm models.  During this discussion we all agreed that most of these issues had already been raised and addressed by George Albanis in the following documents:   1.  EnronCredit.com Project Proposal - Movement Model and Parallel Work - Phases IV,  by George Albanis, December 2000   2.  Meeting 25/01/2001 - Review, by George Albanis.     I also forwarded copies of these documents to you and Ben via email on May 11th.  Just in case you cant find them, I will forward them again.   Based on recent discussions with Jeff Kinneman, it is my understanding that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to figure out how to repair the public firm models.  Hence it may be more appropriate to direct any future concerns about the public firm models to their attention.

If you havent sent the report to him yet, perhaps we can request his opinions on best practices for testing models with limited quality out of sample test sets.  Obviously, Id like to discuss this in detail with you as well, especially since you understand the characteristics of the models and data better now, but Ill do that via phone.  Im hoping there are some statistical techniques were currently ignoring that we can employ to maximize the testing we do and get a better handle on judging our accuracy.  If youve got some time Tuesday after our meeting where Mike catches us up on the D&B issues, Id love to get your views as the model testbed is now in place and were starting a model recalbration phase.  Im least comfortable about our plans for stress testing the models once weve recalibrated them.  Looking forward to talking to you Tuesday.

Visit Toshiba.com for more details.  http://www.nytimes.com/ads/toshiba/index.html   \----------------------------------------------------------/  The Real Wolf  RECKONINGS By PAUL KRUGMAN    ecently I received a letter from an economist I respect, chiding me for my Naderite columns on the California energy crisis. He just didnt believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried Wolf! so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims.   But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state - and nobody will believe it.   True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators.   But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isnt workable competition in Californias power market, and that the actions of generators gaming the system have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently - and very profitably - short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought to be lots of excess capacity.   As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the states power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You cant tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market - a view shared by a growing number of other researchers.   Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say apparently because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote, with William Massey - the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls - voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual.   Whats wrong with FERCs plan? First, it caps prices only in emergency conditions - ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not.   Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls megawatt laundering - selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to imports from neighboring states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient.   The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there - indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts - but FERC has ignored all of them.   The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesnt get it, that it just cant bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last weeks action was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls the FERC plan a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout from the looming disaster.   Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief.  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/opinion/29KRUG.html?ex=989601563&ei=1&en=6a900f004b3b1abf  /-----------------------------------------------------------------\   Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the Web, updated throughout the day.

Identifying the best research problems in terms of 1) highest innovation potential and 2) highest projected impact would be at the top of my list. It might be unprofessional on my side to talk to an audience that I dont have any prior information about and is very diverse anyway; it could actually be dangerous. I would feel MUCH more comfortable to do that in my second visit, after I have understood the  environment better and I have some results to talk about. I would like to be in a position to impress people when I give my first talk at Enron. (Besides, I will have to prepare good slides for such a talk and I am totally swamped all next week.)  > 3.

According to DISG 24 Tagging Constraint Trades (21 Dec 99) Option  3(a) [the option that is proposed to be adopted], paragraph 2.3 (p.4):  In the relevant Settlement Period, all accepted Offers and Bids volumes that  can be arbitraged, i.e. where a volume has been bid higher than the price at  which a volume has been offered, are eliminated;  One of the implications of the above procedure is that the highest bids (the  McCoy bids) and the lowest offers (the McCoy offers) are likely to be  eliminated from the calculation of imbalance prices. This will make it harder  to pursue the McCoy strategy successfully.  Thoughts and comments welcome.  Thanks,  Eklavya.

__label__DontSave	ModReg for Argentina Folks, Heres some preliminary comments on the model we are using for Argentina.  Please correct me on any misunderstandings!  ModReg was written by consultants in Buenos Aires.  Documentation is available in Spanish only.  All data input is by means of text files, which require column orientated input, ie numbers must go into specific columns.  Detailed documentation has been provided specifying the data format for each file.  A weekly time step is used, with five load blocks per week, and a time horizon of one year, typically.  Each model run requires about 6 hours of processing.  ModReg is a modified version of the model used by the grid operator.  It is coded in Fortran and requires a CPLEX licence.  CPLEX is a powerful linear programming solver, developed by ILOG.  As the model is written in Fortran, the very good higher level interface to CPLEX is not available, so the code will have to access CPLEX at a lower level.  We have no documentation describing how the model algorithms.  Source code is not available at present.  ModReg appears to model around 30 busses and 71 lines.  Lines are characterised by from bus number, to bus number, maximum MW capacity in each direction, a percentage  loss factor, cost of transmission in each direction, and some other details.  Demand data is specified by week and load block for each bus.  Thermal plants have a heat rate and maintenance schedule specified, with the possibility of multiple fuels. I understand that hydro generation schedules for each historical inflow condition are an input to the model as they are calculated elsewhere.  From the above it appears that we have an unsatisfactory situation:  ModReg is difficult to use  we do not know in detail what the model does  we do not have documentation describing the algorithm   because source code is not available, we are completely dependent on the consultants.  If Enron is to continue modeling Argentina, we should as a minimum have a model that we understand, is reasonably easy to use, and is documented.  A graphical user interface is really needed to make ModReg easier to use.  Documentation is of course essential.  We should not use a model developed by consultants without documentation.  These steps would enable us to have more confidence in model results, and shortens the learning curve to enable more people to use model.    SDDP is likely to be a suitable replacement.  It would require reseroir inflow data rather than the calculated generations.  The regional loads etc could be modeled using the DC loadflow feature, with zero impedance lines.  Transmission losses in SDDP are a quadratic function of power flows, so some guesses would have to be made for line resistence values.  Setting up an SDDP model to represent all the aspects included in ModReg would be a time consuming job, that would require a good undertanding of the data for both models.  Some direct cut and paste of data from one models files to the others will be possible with a suitable column oriented text editor.  However the end result would be a model with the desirable attributes of documention, GUI interface, and flexible output.

__label__DontSave	COM course from Durasoft Durasoft (the company that did the Java class) will be holding a course on COM object programming for Enron Networks.  COM allows for programs to be written such that they are available for execution to other programs on a language independent basis.  Several Research members are interested in this technology.  The class is $15,000 for 15 people and NetWorks has a few spaces that are unfilled.  We can send a few people, therefore, for about $1000 each.  The course is May 14-18 (which conflicts with the EPRM 2001 Conference), so they need a total soon.  Is this course something group members can sign up for?

I plan on attending, and will enjoy seeing you again.  I dont know if your schedule is too full but it would be great to catch up if you have any time.  The first semester here in school roars on.  We had our first midterm today (accounting).  For me, it feels like school will be over very quickly.  Not surprisingly for Charlotte and the boys, it probably cant be over soon enough.  I hope things are well with you and everyone else in Research.

__label__Save	RE: EOL Pricing Algorithm Hi Bob,  some comments : 1.  You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.  I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights. 2.  You request bid-mid-ask prices for each trade --- given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order (especially for limit orders), would you need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over this time interval (time of order to time of execution)?  Also, for failed trades, you may need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection.  This again mainly applies to limit orders, as the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed of execution (something to check).   -----Original Message----- From:  Lee, Bob   Sent: Monday, April 23, 2001 8:33 AM To: Kaminski, Vince; Shanbhogue, Vasant; Barkley, Tom Cc: Lu, Zimin; Huang, Alex; Gibner, Stinson Subject: EOL Pricing Algorithm  A draft data request for EOL data we would use to study P&L patterns for the George pricing algorithm is attached for your review.

He answered correctly in the optimization question so I believe that he has a good foundation on his optimization skill. I have a doubt about his stochastic skill because he took only one course in Stochastic Processes and his previous models are simple deterministic models. If we had more interview time I would be able to check his stochastic and modeling skills.  He completely failed to answer the second question, which is to check his basic risk management skill. It is clear to me that he has a very weak background in finance and risk management. He does not understand the relationship between a discount rate and risk. He showed some weakness in annuity calculation.   In conclusion, I feel that he has good basic in optimization but a very weak background in finance. Based on his experiences, I have a doubt on his advance optimization skills, such as his stochastic skill and his ability to attack a complex optimization problem. I would recommend a second-round interview if he will be solving a complex-optimization problem.   -Chonawee Zimin Lu <Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT> zimin.lu@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski <Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT> vince.kaminski@enron.com Stinson Gibner <Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT> stinson.gibner@enron.com  Pinnamaneni Krishnarao <Pinnamaneni Krishnarao/HOU/ECT@ECT> pinnamaneni.krishnarao@enron.com

__label__DontSave	Thank You Vince,  I simply wanted to jot you this note because I find that I am sometimes able to address things better in writing than in a conversation.  I want to convey my thanks to you for putting up with me through this period.  I guess I was a bit shell shocked after seeing the project I had worked on, and the team I had built from scratch just going down in a matter of days, not to mention the changes on the personal side.  Through this period you offered me the type of support that perhaps no one else would have, and I want to say that I really appreciate it.  Over this period I got so entangled in my own problems and worries that I forgot that leadership is all about caring for others and not yourself.  My house is now in order, and I am back to my old self.  I want to offer you my full support at this time, and am at your service on whatever issue it is that you wish me to take up.  The company is facing trying times, and I would like to help in whatever way I can.  Please do put as much pressure on me as you would like.  I promise that I will push myself to the limit.  I am ready for the commitment to learn new skills, and have already been doing this, though it has been a slow process.  I will require yours and others guidance from time to time, but will be ready for anything you suggest.  Regards, Sandeep.  PS:    I have written Paula a note (after our conversation yesterday), and will follow up with her.

__label__DontSave	 Vince,  just wanted to summarize for you how I see the issues related to Credit Reserve and Var models:  Credit Reserve: In order to address RACs requests and questions related to this model Research needs to be able to compile and run the code. These procedures are not straight forward. Compilation and running can be done by  using some scripts prepared by IT. Runs by different users can interfere with each other and with production runs. All this involves knowledge of Java, Corba, multi-threading, etc. and our ITs specific implementations, files locations.... We need IT support in doing this. I asked RAC (Debbie Brackett), IT (Winston, Steve Stock) for this. The reaction  was not positive. I even guess they assume that I struggle for the ownership of the code. Our calls to IT guys are considered as interruptions in their work. _______________________________________________________________________________________ Var Model: Convolution VAR (Naveens approach) is under way. At the end of this month (according to IT) it will more or less work. It is based on 60 factor model (which I suggested, but which was not implemented for our Monte Carlo model). There will be no way to perform proper testing of the convolution VAR even for normal distributions (in this case - Analytical VAR). There are no plans of such testing, as far as I know. What will happen is comparison with backtesting for our 5000 portfolios and then endless discussions which portfolios VAR numbers are better or worse for the new method.  ________________________________________________________________________________________   Thank you for your help,  Tanya Tamarchenko, Tanya </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=TTAMARC> tanya.tamarchenko@enron.com enron.com Kaminski j.kaminski@enron.com

By Jeb Bolding  In October I talked about Relera, which at that time, announced that it was getting out of the managed-services business. Before it made the announcement I visited its Internet data center in Denver and what comes to my mind when I think about the discussion I had with its CEO, and my impression of the facilities is one word: scale.  Everything was about having the best partners, the biggest data center, massive systems redundancy rates, etc. No doubt, there is a place for that corporate mentality, and Releras focus on scale should be a comfort to many enterprise companies. Relera may have just been unfortunate with its timing in the market and it may yet be successful with its focus.  As a counterpoint, yesterday I visited another local Internet data center provider, Inflow. Like Relera, Inflow is headquartered in Denver, and like Relera, it is focused at second-tier cities such as Nashville and Minneapolis, though it does have some first-tier city locations.  The similarities, in my opinion, end there. Inflows corporate esprit de corps seems to revolve around smaller is better.  As an example, the data centers are smaller, somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 square feet. Not only does this bring data center profitability sooner based upon allocated space, but it also gives, in the words of Inflow executives, a more personal touch to the relationship between the data-center managers and Inflows customers.  Further to this point, instead of effectively building its own substations, Inflow ensures that each of its data centers (there are three in Denver) are located on different power grids. While this may not put you in complete control over your own destiny, its a reasonable, and cost-efficient solution based upon the statistical likelihood of a disaster.  While Inflows costs are considerably less, the features of its facilities do not appear to be diminished.  All data centers are mirror images of one another (other than the square footage), so that a customer walking into a Nashville facility will be just as at home in a Denver center.  All the services, from simple co-location, to managed security services and monitoring, are replicated similarly across the various locations.  And your single operational account representative is your focal service point regardless of how many Inflow data centers youre in. Management is fully integrated between the data centers so that your customer representative does not have to be local to your issues in order to solve them.  No doubt, there is a place in the business world for Relera and Inflow. Inflow may have just lucked out that its focus on costs will help the company better weather a long downturn.  _______________________________________________________________ To contact Jeb Bolding:  Jeb Bolding is senior consultant with Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder, Colo., an analyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on enterprise management.

Id like to leave San Francisco non-stop to Houston on United 1556 at 11:10 am Jan 9, arriving 4:44pm, then go to Austin on the late afternoon of the 10th (for a seminar at UT), then I need to get from Austin to San Francisco on the evening of the 11th. (There is a United flight 419 connecting through Denver that leaves Austin at 5:30 pm, connecting to United 409 out of Denver). If there is a non-stop from Austin to San Francisco or San Jose, that is even better. (United, my preferred, does not have a non-stop from Austin to the Bay Area.)

__label__Save	Stanford Associate Recruiting I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of you for your  participation in the Stanford Associate interviews last week.  Our efforts  resulted in 6 summer associate offers and 1 full-time associate offer.   Althea Gordon will be e-mailing you the names of the individuals who will  receive offers.  We would like you to contact these individuals to  congratulate them and encourage their acceptance.  Althea will match you up  with the candidates you interviewed and provide you with contact information.  Althea has verbally contacted both the offers and the declines.  We will be  sending out both offer letters and decline letters by end of day Tuesday,  March 20.  In the meantime, should any of you be contacted by students who  did not receive an offer, I recommend the following verbal response:  Our summer program is highly competitive, forcing us to choose a smaller  number of candidates from a highly qualified pool.  Our summer hiring this  year will be between 35-40 associates.  The full-time program typically hires  between 80-90 associates.  Given that you made it this far in our selection  process, I would strongly encourage you to apply in the fall for the  full-time associate program.  We will keep you informed via e-mail of our acceptance rate at Stanford.  Again, thank you for your support.  We look forward to working with you on  potential future Stanford recruiting events.

__label__Save	Preface for book Vince, ? Hope you are well. ? We spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book, and =  you kindly offered that you would provide this.? Is this still  possible?? = We realise that you are extremely busy, so Chris and Les went  ahead and wrote=  something, which is below, and if you want to review, change or  re-write?t= he preface, that would be very appreciated.? Let me know  what your thoughts a= re. ? Thanks, Julie (were getting close) ? ?  Preface  ?  ?  ?  One of our main objectives in  writing Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk=  Management has been to bring  together as many of the various approaches fo= r the pricing and risk management  energy derivatives as possible, to discuss=  in-depth the models, and to show how  they relate to each other.? In this =  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models, price a wid= e  range of energy derivatives, or to build a risk management system which use= s a  consistent modelling framework.? We  believe that for practitioners this=  last point is very important and we continue  to stress in our articles and=  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk  management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using  ad-hoc and inconsiste= nt models for different instruments and markets (see also OTHERS WHO PROPOSE=  CONSISTENT  MODELS?).? However, it is not  our wish to concentrate on one=  particular model or models, at the exclusion of  the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user  (although it will probab= ly be clear from our discussions the model(s) we  prefer).? We therefore try a= nd give  as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of al= l the  models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models=  which  best suit their needs.  ?  In order to meet our objectives the  book is divided into 11 chapters.?  In=  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to  mode= l and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the  book= .? In addition to introducing  the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes=  modelling framework we outline  the numerical techniques of trinomial trees=  and Monte Carlo simulation for  derivative pricing, which are used througho= ut the book.  ?  In Chapter 2 we discuss the  analysis of spot energy prices.? As  well as=  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes  that=  can be used to model the prices.?  We look at the well-know process of Geometric Brownian Motion as well as  mean reversion, stochastic volatility=  and jump processes, discussing each and  showing how they can be simulated=  and their parameters estimated.  ?  Chapter 3, written by Vince  Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of Enron Corp., discusses volatility  estimation in energy commodity markets.?=   This chapter builds on the previous one.? It examines in detail the methods= ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different=   pricing models introduced in chapter 2.?  Examples from crude, gas, and electricity markets are used to illustrate  the technical and interpretativ= e aspects of calculating volatility.  ?  Chapter 4 examines forward curves  in the energy markets.? Although  such=  curves are well understood and straight-forward in the most financial  markets, the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less wel= l  defined curves.? In this chapter we  describe forward price bounds for ener= gy prices and the building of forward  curves from market instruments.? We  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward  curves in energy markets; the arbitrage approach, the econometric=  approach, and  deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochasti= c factors.  ?  Chapter 5 presents an overview of  structures found in the energy derivativ= e markets and discusses their uses.? Examples of products analysed in this =  chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as energy  swaptions, compound options, Asian options, barrier options, lookba= ck options,  and ladder options.  ?  Chapter 6 investigates single and  multi-factor models of the energy spot=  price and the pricing of some standard  energy derivatives.? Closed form =  solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option prices  both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the=  models in  this chapter including a three factor, stochastic convenience yield and interest  rate model.  ?  Chapter 7 shows how the prices of  path dependent and American style option= s can be evaluated for the models in  Chapter 6.? Simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a variety  of path dependent options.? In order  to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial  tree scheme is developed.? This tree  is built to be consistent with the observed forward=  curve and can be used to  price exotic as well as standard European and American style options.  ?  Chapter 8 describes a methodology  for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed  forward curve.? The approach results  in a multi-factor model that is able to realistically capture the=  evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves.?  The user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general  form.? Closed-form solutions are  developed for pricing standard European options, and efficie= nt Monte Carlo  schemes are presented for pricing exotic options.? The chapter=  closes with a discussion of  the valuation of American style options.  ?  Chapter 9 focuses on the risk  management of energy derivative positions.? =  In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions =  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem  of managing the risk through time.?  We begin with delta hedging a=  portfolio containing derivatives and look  at extensions to gamma hedging = =01) illustrating the techniques using both spot and  forward curve models.? The=  general  model presented in Chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi-factor hedging of a  portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed.  ?  Chapter 10 examines the key risk  management concept of Value at Risk (VaR)=  applied to portfolios containing  energy derivative products.? After  discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs  (volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.? We then=  compare the fours major  methodologies for computing VaR; Delta, Delta-gamm= a, historical simulation and  Monte-Carlo simulation, applying each to the sam= e portfolio of energy  options.? In this chapter we also  look at testing the=  VaR estimates for various underlying energy market  variables.  ?  Finally, in Chapter 11 we review  modelling approaches to credit risk.?  We=  look in detail at two quite different approaches, CreditMetrics (J. P. Morg= an (1997)) and  CreditRisk+ (Credit Suisse Financial  Products (1997)) for whi= ch detailed information is publicly available.? Together these provide an extensive set  of tools with which to measure credit risk.? We present numerical examples of  applying these techniques to energy derivatives.  ? Before  we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this=  book are tools  which should be used with the benefit of an understanding o= f how both the =01+tool=01,  and the market works.? The  techniques we descri= be are certainly not =01&magic wands=018 which can be waved at  data and risk mana= gement problems to provide instant and perfect solutions.? To quote from the RiskMetrics Technical  Document =01&=01( no amount of sophisticated analyti= cs will replace experience and  professional judgement in managing risk.=018.?

__label__Save	Independent Variables for ENE Regressions Brad,  As we discussed, its very difficult to find drivers of the ENE stocks  behaviours.  We investigated about 30 comparable stocks, 10 capital market  indices, and three energy commodity indices.  Regular regressions as well as  regressions with different legs and leads were performed.  Some variables  show significant correlated with ENE stock during particular time periods,  but most of those correlation disappears when we tested them over different  or longer time periods.   Only two variables, S&P Utility Index(SPXU) and  DOW Jones Utility  Index(UTIL), show stable and significant relationship with ENE stock (a  summary of these relationship can be found in the attached file  outputSummary).  But as you can see, the R2 are below 30%.  Also, the ?Durbin-Watson statistics tell us to be careful about autocorrelation.?Basically, the regression analysis so far confirms our original opinion -- ?its hard, if not impossible, to find out any real driver of the ENE stock.  ?After Enron added new core business several month ago, the stock behaved more ?or less like a tele_comm stock,  which suggests that ENRON stock has entered ?into a new phase.  To capture, at least  trying to capture,  its ?characteristics in the new phase, we need a lit bit more time to cumulate the ?market date.??Let me know if you need me investigate more variables or you come up with ?some new thoughts.????Vincent??

To achieve   this goal, the BFS organizes every two years an International Congress.      The scientific program of the 2002 BFS Congress consists of plenary   talks and contributed papers. The invited plenary talks will give an   overview of the latest important developments in the field. They will   also present new ideas, directions and methodologies from Finance,   Economics, Econometrics and Mathematics and, discuss pressing problems   in the Finance and Insurance industries. The contributed papers will   complement the plenary talks with recent results and advances.       The overall scope is to create a unique interdisciplinary forum for   discussion of new concepts, incite stronger interaction across the   fields, and, at the same time, define new directions for the future   development of Mathematical Finance.

I would like to know if Enron would be interested in sponsoring one or more student teams in an energy finance practicum next semester.  I have attached a document with a description of the program, and details on what the level of commitment is for a sponsor (no financial commitment is required).  Sponsorships can only be given by the eight trustees of CEFER (the Center for Energy Finance Education & Research).  Dr. Ronn serves as a faculty advisor for each team. Lexi Elliott suggested that you and Traci would be the appropriate people to contact for such a request.  Could you let me know if Enron would be interested in sponsoring a team next semester, and who my point of contact should be in the event that you would like to participate?  Feel free to contact me if you would like some more details on the program. Thanks,  Stephen Jensen   <<EFG Practicum Program.doc>>   Stephen E.

__label__Save	Credit Support Value for MG and PaperCo Find below a spreadsheet with my very rough calculation of the value of  credit support for MG and PaperCo.  My approach is as follows:  1.   Assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps. 2.   Spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors. 3.   Calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap (the  default option)  using Blacks formula. 4.   Treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows.  That is  treat this value just like you would an annuity stream.  By discounting back  this stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk-reduced  rate, I find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the two  NPVs.  Please give your comments, especially if this makes no sense to you.

Rgds, Sandeep.     -----Original Message----- From:  Curry, Wanda   Sent: Thursday, October 11, 2001 5:44 PM To: Kilchrist, Shawn; Parsons, Andrew; Bharati, Rakesh; Kohli, Sandeep; Walker, Mark A.; john.e.sorrells@us.andersen.com Cc: Beck, Sally Subject: Operational Risk Management  I want to move forward with scheduling the initial meeting of the Operational Risk Management task force.  How does Tuesday, October 16th and the afternoon of Thursday, October 18th look for everyone?  Please let me know your schedule for both of these dates.  Most of the task force members have been identified, with the exception of those from GRMO and IT.  Sally Beck will identify representatives from these two areas.  I would also expect that other individuals may be consulted from time to time as additional expertise or resources or required.    I intend to schedule a two-hour block of time for this meeting.  The agenda will include, at a minimum,  the following topics:   Definition of Operational Risk for  Enron - Whats in and Whats Out  Preliminary Goals for Operational Risk Management (to be refined by the group)       Develop Common Language                  Identify Framework for Monitoring Risk       Role of this task force  - Strategy       Set common objectives for implementation this year and a look forward to 2002  Current Initiatives  Communications Plan   Open Discussion - Other Ideas from the group       - Suggestions re other groups/individuals to include on the task force    I am excited about leading this initiative for Enron.  We have a unique opportunity to define operational risk measurement for Enron, develop reporting guidelines, and provide qualitative assessments of operational risk, all of which will be considered during the risk capital allocation process.   But most importantly, we can identify ways to mitigate Enrons exposure to operational risk.  Please call if you would like to discuss any of the above prior to the meeting.

__label__Save	Weather team & Stinson Gibner John,   I hope you had a good Easter weekend. I typically take Monday Easter off but   this year too much was going on.   Two items I wanted to mention:   1. Tony Hamilton, weather support   Tony Hamilton, a meteorologist Ph.D. hired to support Global Markets, spent  a   few weeks in Houston, in training with Mike Roberts team. He went back to   London 10 days ago and he hit the ground running. He is supporting not only   crude and weather derivatives, but also gas and power, and is inundated with   requests for help.    He is supported by another member of Mike Roberts team, Steve Bennett, on a   temporary assignment (10 days planned originally).    Action recommended.    a. Extension of Steve Bennett temporary assignment for a few more weeks. I   have already authorized extension till the 27th. I shall speak more with  Tani   on Wednesday about it. ?b. ?Hiring another weather person to work with Tony   Hamilton, supporting gas and power across continental Europe.     2. Stinson Gibner   Slava is currently in Houston, learning more about research group here and   building a network of relationships. I have a very high opinion of Salvia -   he is a very bright person, very personable and hard working. I still worry   about the depth and breadth of his experience, his understanding of the   totality of Enron business and the relative ?importance of multiple   activities we have to support. I think it makes sense to have a more   experienced research person coaching him for 18-24 months. I talked to Bryan   Seyfried and Ted Murphy and they expressed similar concerns about the depth   of support they expect.   Action recommended.   I still think it makes sense to bring Stinson Gibner to London for an   extended stay. To manage Slavas expectations, I would call Stinson a Head  of   Research for Europe and Asia. His responsibility would also include   coordination of research and model building for other locations than London   where I see a lot of activity that goes on without regular audits and ?  reviews we have in Houston, and over which we have no control (except for   reacting to requests for assistance). I propose that Stinson come to London   in the next few days to discuss the potential assignment with you.    By the way, Greg Whalley agrees with the idea of a senior research person in   London. He, however, recommended Vasant - stronger work ethics is the main   consideration.

__label__DontSave	RE: visit to Houston Dear Vince,  I will be in Houston from the 1 July to (at least) the 7th July.   I will call you tomorrow morning (Houston time) to discuss the current issues and how we can move forward in a way that is beneficial  for Enron North America (the research group, the gas desk and the power desk).

__label__Save	Todays Discussion Anjam, thanks for organising this - and Vince thanks for making yourself  available for the discussion.  I am working for Joe Gold and my group is concerned with adding the web as an  additional sales and communication channel for our European business units.  Through the web we are also able to convey a more local image, rather than  presenting ourselves as a Texan company through Enron.com. To set you into perspective about what we have in mind I have attached a  brief presentation which has been the basis for the sign off of the project.    We intend to display a wide training section for the following reasons: document our know-how base educate the market participants generate great stickiness (participants should know that if they need to know  s.th. on energy risk mgt. they should go to Enron) later on: have the option to commercialise this area.

In this manner we could be doing short term deals and increasing despatch  from Dabhol or other MSEB marginal units.  Any money flowing from these sales  should go into an escrow account that goes directly towards payment of DPC  bills.  In this manner we would be increasing the payment ability of MSEB.

__label__Save	Option Valuation John,  I think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and  elimination of risks through hedges (as correctly pointed out  in other messages). Being  aware of risk does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.  Now a few more detailed comments.  1. I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined  with  a project finance discount rate. Illiquidity discount, in my view, should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without  sufficient depth. One should apply a haircut if liquidating  a position takes a long time. The  approach used in valuation of the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of  investments in physical assets, which are by definition illiquid. This illiquidity  is recognized  through other aspects of valuation technology used in RAROC.   If we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent  and use this approach  across the board for all project finance type cases (not that  I recommend this course of action).  2. Valuation of an unheadgable options.  Lets look at it from the position of a seller of the option.  He cannot hedge a short call or put and Black-Scholes valuation becomes the  floor for the valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as  opposed to taking a vol risk when he hedges). The issue of the compensation he will require becomes  fuzzy. The option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on  two factors:  1. risk preference 2. existing portfolio positions  Risk preference. Insurance companies typically require a payment that  consists of two parts: expected loss + unexpected loss. The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2  standard deviations. The number of  standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability  to absorb the loss. I admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works. We  looked into insurance pricing at the request of Jere Overdyke. You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more  about it.  Existing portfolio positions. An additional contract may increase or decrease  the risk of the overall portfolio. I would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not  look to me as a deal that reduces risk (given all our positions in this region).  What are the practical implications? Pricing depends on risk appetite (the  utility function of a decision maker in technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary.   If we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged, we should subtract from the value of the contract the value of the option (that is greater than the Black - Scholes value). If we dont price this option explicitly, the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk  premium.  In the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed. If he cannot  hedge, he should recognize the risk of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of  the option. How big is the discount? See the comments above.   In the special case, where hedging is possible and the Black-Scholes-Merton  paradigm applies, both values will become equal (ignoring transaction costs). The values of an option form  the point of view of  a seller and a buyer will converge.  3. What happens in case we use simulation technology?  We can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will  recognize the downside and/or upside at different points in time in different states of the world). If we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of  NPV as of today. Knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases  we are still holding it. The expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk. This is  equivalent to using a  discount rate with a risk premium.  I hope this helps. Please, call me with additional questions. Sorry for a  delay in responding to this question. I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant, to make sure we  all agree. Its a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not  have good answers.

__label__DontSave	Re: HSX volume info FYI. update on movie trading business.  I change my mind. At first I though that we should focus on customers who want to diversify their unique risks. But now I feel that, at this moment, the make-sense people are not easy to find in reality. (Even myself who own Enron stock, not Dynergy.) There are more risk takers than risk diversified people. So I think speculators might be our customers in this movie business. -chonawee   ---------------------- Forwarded by Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron on 05/02/2001 11:23 AM ---------------------------   Chonawee Supatgiat 05/02/2001 11:23 AM To: Russell Woody/Enron Communications@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS, Key Kasravi/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Richard DiMichele/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Martin Lin/Contractor/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Greg Woulfe/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: HSX volume info     Thanks, Key, for the volume information. Because HSX is a fake market, I think this indicates that there are lots of speculators out there in the movie trading business. So I believe speculators might be one of our major customers. (Like stock markets, a (big?) part of brokers profits are from speculators commissions.)  I know the diversification is a good thing to do but may be hard to do in reality. Even for myself, who is working for Enron and owning Enron shares, I would not buy Dynergy stocks even if it makes sense to do that for reducing my unique risk...  In stead, I buy Enron shares, so I am a speculator (risk taker) myself...   Regarding moral-hazzard/information-asymmetry issue in the movie business, the market price will reflect this risk. In addition, I think we can 1) try not taking any position or 2) have a diversified portfolio of movies.   If we operate as a broker and maintain balanced books, one question is how much we have to invest to create these markets...

Personally, I am blown away by the large membership HSX claims.   Even if they have a decent percentage of these numbers, that would suggest that movies and the related industry is becoming sport as well as entertainment.  I guess the fact that you can already find on the front page of your newspaper such information as weekend box office receipts suggests that a lot of people really are interested in movies beyond the content.

__label__DontSave	 Vince,    Ive been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM. I just wanted to warn you that Im not sure this is in Enrons long-term interest at all.  Let me explain why.  Feel free to give me a call if youd like to talk more about this.    First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides.  The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.    However, bear in mind FERCs desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices.    In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.    As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.  Frank Frank A.

__label__DontSave	Options approach for EOL price setting Vince,  Over the weekend, I fomulated the idea using option pricing for the EOL  price seeting rules. The initial results look interesting.  I will write it up for your inputs.  Also attach is the program SnagIt, for printing window.  Zimin     -------------------- main idea ------------------------------  A market maker fulfills the obligation to provide liquidity, therefore he should be compensated for his service. In the option langauge, the market maker sells options to the traders, for a market order to buy, the market maker has to sell at the ask price and for a market order to sell, the market maker has to buy at the bid price. When the ask price is hit the trader exercised a call option against the market maker, when the bid price is lifted, the trader exercised a put. The option premium that the traders paid to the market maker is implicitly embedded in the bid-ask spread.  There is a capital requirement for the market making. In a rising (falling) market, the market maker will accumulate a net short (long) position. There are two kind of costs. The first is associated to carry the market-to-market(MTM) value to the next period. The market maker needs to charge a risk-free interest for the carrying the inventory to the next period. The second is the charge for the risk capital. If the ask (bid) were hit (lifted) in a rising (falling) market, the market maker would realized a loss reflecting the MTM change. Thus, the risk capital that the market maker laid aside is the amount of money that he is prepared to lose, in exchange for some return. The risk adjusted return on capital or RAROC rate reflects the risk attitude of the market maker in providing the liquid to the market participants.  In balance, the market maker sells options to compensate his costs in provide market liquidity. From this train of thoughts, I derive a formula for the bid and ask prices as function of the last executed price, inventory level, price volatility, trade size, order arrival rate, risk-free interest rate and RAROC rate. The limit orders are not considered here, since there are very few limit orders traded on EnronOnLine (EOL). Lu, Zimin lu@enron.com enron.com Kaminski j.kaminski@enron.com

Fast REP is a powerful graphical method to compare risk management policies. It focuses on extreme potential losses and potential pain points. While having some similar characteristics with the VAR (Value at Risk) framework and the Nobel-prize winning Markowitz model of variance minimization for a prescribed mean rate of return, it shifts the focus from an investment orientation to a risk management perspective extremely appropriate for a variety of industries, such as energy or telecom.   This methodology has been created by Stanford University Prof Sam Chiu and myself, and is now being applied as consulting services by Oncept. Attached is a copy of an unpublished article on the subject. We will adapt it or modify it to fit your editorial constraints, should you be interested.

Maybe I am following your starting career in Academia.  I had an interview with Enron Sydney with Raymond Yeow (but did not make the grade) ~ pricing interruptible options. Well my other friend Quentin Kerr who sent over his papers with (Professor Burrage and Professor Gray from the University of Queensland) to you had an interview with your Houston office (but he did not make the grade) also.By the way how were the papers?

__label__Save	California Update 5/4/01 If you have any questions, please contact Kristin Walsh at (713) 853-9510.  Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack=  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the=  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a=  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic= ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc= us is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis.  Many legislative Republic= ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o= nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would double=  dip into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg= islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th= e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac= e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon= g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t= hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in = breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th= e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi= ll be very difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat= e would eat the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately = $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this = concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful= l disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis, including the = details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=  will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB = 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi= ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac= k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo= r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am= ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre= ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowens language states that the state should get = paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li= kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).  According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic= ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in = the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 = of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ= icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=  to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo= rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind= ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.  Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount:$4.125 B Lenders:JP Morgan$2.5 B Lehman Brothers$1.0 B Bear Stearns$625 M Tax Exempt Portion:Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate:Taxable Rate5.77% Tax-Exempt Rate4.77% Current Projected Blended IR:5.38% Maturity Date:August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t= he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut= horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi= tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power = going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz= ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor = has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is = that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f= urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it = is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas= ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif= ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi= dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl= ier in the crisis.  SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T= he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the = governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au= gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t= o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s= igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi= s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat= es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank= ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.   The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is= suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s= tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th= en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st= ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p= assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

__label__Save	Introduction ---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 06/28/2000  07:55 AM ---------------------------   <avi.hauser@effem.com> on 06/20/2000 03:12:53 PM To: Vince J Kaminski <Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com> cc: richard.larsen@effem.com  Subject: Introduction   Vince:     As way of introduction, I wanted to write a bit about Mars inc. and then about CDS, the unit I head.  Mars is a private company, considered to be the largest privately owned manufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing  its finances, so the best I could do is refer to Forbes estimate of $15 Billion annual revenue and to the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in the business of manufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R)) food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and other products.  Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that emphasizes the long term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-win solutions with its suppliers, customers and partners.  As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of its expenses goes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history of researching those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand (people eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).  CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been very successful, with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage in these arenas. CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports  the purchasing function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is a multidiscipline and multinational team with a lot to offer.  Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile based on manufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in  this area. Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to talk to.  In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing to anything at this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to pursue the opportunity we discussed in the future.  I am looking forward to our video conference call.  Kind regards,  Avi    --------------------------------------- Avi I.

__label__DontSave	Our telephone discussion Dear Mr. Kaminski,  This e-mail is in reference to our telephone conversation on December 2,  regarding possible opening at Enron Research (I was referred to you by  Stinson Gibner).  Briefly, I am a geoscientist with Enron Global Exploration  and Production (EGEP).  Enron Corp. recently decided to divest all of the  EGEPs oil and gas assets and exit the upstream industry.  As a result, I am  searching for a new position within Enron.  Having done some research on the  activities of various groups at Enron, I think that my science background,  experience and skills may be best suitable for the Enron Research Group.  I would appreciate your review of my resume (attached) and your comments  about any job opportunity within Enron Research.  Please feel free to call me  at ext. 67604 if you have any questions.

__label__DontSave	GPCM News: 12/13/00: Time Slots Available: Canadian Arctic Natural Gas: Gas Storage Levels: Tetco Expansion Time Slots Available on Wednesday  Bob Brooks will be in Houston next week for training and demonstration of the GPCM Natural Gas Market Forecasting System.  There are still two time slots available on Wednesday, December 20.  If you would like to meet with Bob, please contact him at mailto:rebrooks@rbac.com or 323-663-4831.  From http://www.enerfax.com:  Canadian Arctic Natural Gas Development Proceeds     Oil companies that are planning to tap the vast natural gas reserves in the Canadian Arctic say they will soon move past the study stage and could start preparing a regulatory application for a multibillion-dollar pipeline early next year. The group, which includes Imperial Oil, Gulf Canada Resources, Shell Canada and Exxon Mobil, started studying how to develop the 6 Tcf of reserves in the Mackenzie Delta region of the Northwest Territories about a year ago. Over the past year, other oil companies have amassed large land positions in the region, expecting a pipeline with a capacity of more than 1 Bcf per day to be built to southern markets along the Mackenzie River Valley. At the same time, major oil companies led by BP Amoco are formulating plans for developing their own reserves at Prudhoe Bay in northern Alaska, along with a pipeline. Last week, BP, Exxon Mobil and Phillips said they had joined forces to study construction of a pipeline to tap over 35 Tcf of Alaska natural gas. Industry debate has centered on which resources would be developed first, and whether they need to go ahead together. Governments, companies, northern communities and aboriginal groups all have stakes in any development that takes place, and the most optimistic guess as to when volumes could start flowing is at least five years. The Imperial-led group says it has already carried out extensive and open discussions with more than 70 parties representing a variety of interests. Imperial said the study was aided by the consortiums relationship with the Aboriginal Pipeline Group, which represents more than 30 native leaders from the Northwest Territories. Meanwhile, the group had examined various issues related to pipeline funding and ownership, with the aim of making capacity available to all producers in the region. In addition, the companies drew up a draft regulatory road map to streamline that process.  Natural Gas Storage      The AGA is expected to report that natural gas storage levels decreased by about 150 to 180 Bcf when its report is released this afternoon. Last week, the AGA reported storage at 2,429 Bcf for the week ending December 1st, down 73 Bcf from the previous week, and down 503 Bcf  from 1999. With blizzard conditions across much of the nation this week, next weeks withdrawal is expected to be even larger, likely exceeding 200 Bcf. If that is the case, storage levels could drop below 2 Tcf before winter even officially begins. The AGA reported a 73 Bcf withdrawal for the comparable period a year ago. The five-year average is 68 Bcf. Last week, the producing regions storage decreased 11 Bcf to 611 Bcf, 64% of capacity. Producing storage levels are now 226 Bcf below a year ago. The eastern consuming region had a withdrawal of 57 Bcf to 1,495 Bcf, 81% of capacity and 163 Bcf below a year ago. The western region storage levels decreased by 5 Bcf to 323 Bcf, 64% of capacity. Western region storage levels are now 114 Bcf lower than a year ago.  TETCO Plans Incremental Expansion Project for Mid-Atlantic and Northeast      Texas Eastern Transmission plans an open season for its Texas Eastern Incremental Market Expansion, or TIME, a new project to bring additional supplies of natural gas to the growing mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets. TIME will combine unsubscribed existing capacity with incremental firm capacity to create a low-cost expansion option for Texas Eastern shippers. During the open season from December 11th  January 12th, shippers can submit non-binding nominations to move volumes from the Gulf Coast, Chicago/Lebanon lateral and other receipt points on the TETCO system to delivery points in the Northeast.  By utilizing existing capacity that initially served Midwest markets, TIME will enable TETCO to reconfigure its existing pipeline system and with modest additions to existing facilities provide significant increased capacity to mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets at existing approved rates. In recent years, the Northeast and mid-Atlantic markets have experienced renewed growth in traditional markets as well as the construction of new electric generation.  With its ability to bring the capacity to market quickly, TIME is well-positioned to capture this growth.

__label__DontSave	Price Dynamics and Risk Management in the Energy Markets Mr. Kaminski,  Greetings. I work for Aspen Technology Inc. www.aspentech.com We have not met, but a colleague of mine forwarded a copy of your presentation on Price Dynamics in the Energy Markets from the SIAM conference last April and am writing to you to encourage you to consider making a presentation at Aspens corporate world conference Aspen World 2002 in October in Washington DC on this topic as well as the broader topic of Risk assessment and management in the energy markets. I know this seems a little strange making a cold-call in this manner, but I am reaching out in the community of Risk and Uncertainty management in the Supply Chain, Process and Energy markets to identify and solicit compelling speakers. AspenTech does not have a traditionally strong or well developed business or application layer in this realm, but, as our enterprise-wide reach and activities in planning, forecasting and supply chain have grown and integrated, I and the technology drivers in the company have been cultivating a demand and recognition for risk management and pricing activities to BE the next logical dimension to our growth and technology. Therefore, the session I am chairing (see the abstract below) will be one intended to educate, entice, and compel our clientele, business partners and staff on the business value, technology and mathematical and modeling technique. I would be happy to elaborate on the intended audience and opportunity for the conference. Please contact me at your earliest convenience by email or phone at the numbers below to discuss things if you think it would be a possibility or, if you would like more information on the context of the work and subject matter in AspenTechs core businesses.  Thanks in advance for your time.  Sincerely, Skip Paules  Uncertainty and Risk Management in Supply Chain and Process Modeling  This session will examine the assessment and quantification of uncertainties and risk in the supply chain and process modeling arena. The emphasis is on the modeling and enterprise business process aspects. Topics should include: point solution methods, such as design and real-time optimization application at the process level; planning and scheduling applications; as well as enterprise level solution strategies that balance forecasting, supply chain, planning, scheduling and operations. Commodities trading models, strategies and techniques are also included in this scope. What developments in the applications and theory of the field will allow us to take collections of deterministic modeling tools to the next strategic level where objectives for capital projects, operations, and supply chain optimization models incorporate not only economics, but also value-at-risk and/or robustness elements to create more broadly applicable or hedged strategies to achieve the desired goals.  Possible presentation topics will include:  * Uncertain supply, demand in planning and scheduling * Robust plant-wide optimization (real-time) * Robust control * Value-at-risk (VAR) quantification in modeling applications * Dynamic hedging in commodities trading (e.g. energy markets) * Flexible design and synthesis * Model sensitivies to uncertain parameters or demand * General algorithmic and modeling strategies for incorporating Risk, Sensitivity, and/or Uncertainty  _________________________________________ Granville (Skip) E.

__label__Save	Norway Visit: Research Agenda Dear All,  I would like to make myself available for some meetings at the Oslo office  during my visit on Friday pm, Monday and Tuesday.  I believe Bjarne will be  available on Tuesday, if not Monday, and so would like to arrange the Trading  and Origination meetings for Tuesday (so that he can attend) and maybe go  through the EnergyDesk issues on Monday.  I will also give a presentation,  probably on Monday.  TRADING: OPTIONS & VOLATILITY CURVES It would be useful to meet with the traders along with Bjarnes team to help  us improve our understanding of the valuation/hedging issues encountered in  trading options (both European and Asian).  I hope to discuss the vol curves  and will bring the example of the recent work done for the UK electricity  desk where a monthly volatility curve generator and initial half-hourly  forward volatility curve have been developed.  ORIGINATION: Any issues arising in complex deals (e.g. dry reservoir, user-time contracts)  etc. perhaps with Didrik.  ENERGYDESK.COM To support the on-going effort to ensure the accuracy of the EnergyDesk.com  systems, I hope to help James Stephen nail-down the reasons for some of the  discrepancies between the EnergyDesk.com valuation and the Oslo book (for  this I hope to meet with Trond).  EXOTIC OPTIONS: If everything runs smoothly, I plan to roll-out the new Asian model which  should also help us in improving our electricity volatility curve.

__label__Save	Adaptive Trade Vince, Zimin, I participated in a telephone conference on this company this morning.  There  was a possibility Enron would invest in it.  Their product appears to be a GUI interface over the top of ILOG Solver (and  possibly ILOG CPLEX) which allows problems to be expressed in high level  terms.  I do not see any immediate application at Enron, but I am interested  in the concepts used so expressed an interest in a demo.  Maybe it would be  useful for general modelling projects here.  They do not even have a user manual for their software, so it will be  difficult to figure out what it does unless a demo is arranged.  The  possibility for growth in the company seems small as the ILOG software is a  modest size market and their product is aimed at only a small part of that  market.  I think the scheduling tools in SAP, i2, etc are more likely to  succeed than this one as they are already integrated into an information  system.  Because of the small market for this software, the many competitors, the  absence of any clear use for it at Enron and the early stage of development,  there is very little prospect of us funding this company.

__label__DontSave	Plastics Models Vasant,  I wanted to keep you up-to-date on the redevelopment of forward curves for the suite of 7 plastics (ethylene contract, ethylene spot, propylene contract, propylene spot, polypropylene, HDPE, LLDPE).  As you may recall, we talked about fitting all of the components into a VAR model and solving the system of simultaneous equations.  Unfortunately, with a limited dataset (say 5 years or so), our degrees of freedom in such a model are dramatically reduced.  Alternatively, Mauricio and I have decided to construct individual models for each of the plastics commodities while utilizing results from the initial VAR analysis as a guide.    Based on the petrochemicals flowsheet, both propylene and ethylene are fashioned directly from raw materials such as crude oil, coal, and natural gas.  In turn, polypropylene may be made from propylene while HDPE and LLDPE use ethylene as a raw material.  Given this logical flow, we restricted our model specifications in the following manner (all price variables tested for stationarity--first difference used in all cases):  1) Construct models for ethylene contract and ethylene spot based on AR terms, WTI, and natural gas.  Determine the best model between ethylene contract and ethylene spot as a function of these variables (based on R2).  2) Supplement the model above with the smaller R2 value with the contemporaneous and lagged values of the dependent variable from the other model (e.g., construct ethylene contract as a function and WTI and natural gas--construct ethylene spot as a basis to ethylene contract).  3) Repeat the process for propylene refinery grade and propylene chemical grade.    4) For polypropylene, construct a model based on AR terms, contemporaneous and lagged values of propyleneRG, propyleneCG, WTI, and natural gas.  5) For HDPE, construct a model based on AR terms, contemporaneous and lagged values of ethylene contract, ethylene spot, WTI, and natural gas.  6) For LLDPE, construct a model based on AR terms, contemporaneous and lagged values of ethylene contract, ethylene spot, HDPE, WTI, and natural gas.  Note that we are aware of the cascading error problem as we move from model to model.  Alternatively, we can construct each model based only on WTI and natural gas (see first-cut of polypropylene model).  We do have monthly fundamental supply and demand information for 3 of the plastics (polypropylene, HDPE, and LLDPE) and will incorporate this data as well.  Alan Engberg has forwarded the latest 12 month forward curves from the current model that is being used.  He has also offered his own projections for these commodities over the next 12 months.  Well compare the revised model projections with both the old model projections and Alans numbers and then make a decision on next steps.

__label__Save	California Update 3/16/01 ? A source within the generator community confirms press reporting that Coram  Energy plans to file an involuntary bankruptcy early next week.  Through an  intermediary, we were able to corroborate this information with a senior  member of the CA ISO board.  Coram  Energy is a relatively small wind  generator QF based in West Vancouver, British  Columbia, though it also owns  wind stations in California.  Coram has 238  40 kw units.   ? The source believes that this filing may have been precipitated by the   fact that many people believe it would take a blackout for Governor Davis  to  be able to get his bailout plan passed by the legislature.  It is  unlikely  that blackouts would happen in April or May, meaning a  long wait for the  cash strapped QFs to wait to get paid. ? The filing will be against Socal. ? In order to file an involuntary bankruptcy, Coram  would have to file along  with at least two other creditors owed $10,000 or more.  Sources report Coram  has two other creditors who will file with them (working on finding out who  they are). ? Sources also report that other QFs are taking  legal advice on how to  proceed in light of these developments.

__label__DontSave	Re: UK Power/Gas VaR from RisktRAC Hi Ted  A number of points regarding the migration of London office to RisktRAC have  arisen over the last couple of months.  Who is the formal project manager for  Londons migration?  Whenever London RAC or Research have a bright idea (see  below), I want to be sure it either gets actioned, or is turned down - a  point person is just what we need.

VaR should be calculated on a hierarchy basis from  business level to trader level.  Two pints to consider though:  Some of the desks in Europe trade as teams and do not have individual  ownership of positions E.g. UK power cash and term books between 6 traders.  The current Risk Trac hierarchy is designed to provide only three levels and  we probably need four to achieve this.  I think this is worth discussing with IT in Houston to see what is possible  and to devise a hierarchy that will work for RAC and the traders.

I  think that this would be a good idea in the near future as it would help  to focus the attention of the traders on a VaR number that they are more  likely to understand. As I understand it a position term structure can also  be reported via  RisktRAC which would mean that they could check their own poistion feeds  going into the system. I am hoping to try and adopt the same methodology for the metals business as  I think it will help to speed up the  roll out of RisktRAC in the UK office. What are you thoughts on this? Do you think it can be supported by RAC in  London?

__label__Save	Re: EPRM article Chris,  This is very well written and will serve the reader well. A few comments.  1. When I think about the taxonomy of the VaR models, I typically use the  classification based on 3 categories:   a. variance/covariance  method                 b. historical simulation                 c. Monte Carlo simulation.  Delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear  instrument.  2. I would define Monte Carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation  of behavior of all the market prices/rates, etc., and revaluation of the entire portfolio. The revaluation may be based on an approximation (using Taylors expansion)  that may  involve delta, delta/gamma, delta/gamma/omega or may be exact (based on the  same model that produces the mark-to-market portfolio valuations).  The main benefit of using the  MC simulation in the energy markets is the  ability to capture the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way. I would  emphasize that there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the V/C model (I shall send you  the references  from home).  3. I would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets  that are evolving quickly (new instruments for which we have no comparable prices, behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de-mature).  4. For bigger portfolios, virtually all methods require some level of  aggregation into  atomic, elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. This process may be a source of a big error.  5. The computational burden of MC can be reduced through clever preprocessing of a portfolio that introduces no error. Many swaps with the same underlying can be aggregated into one positions ( they are  portfolios of forwards and  they are linear instruments).  Please, feel free to use any comment (or none).

Subject: FW: CV   Vince,  I met with Niki last week in which we had a general interview on his interests.  He is finding that he is not fully utilizing his skills at Optimark and that the company is moving more towards software development.  Consequently he is looking at other possibilities.  He obviously has an interesting background that includes systems development, management and a strong technical training.  Ideally, he could fit somewhere between research and systems development.  Somewhat of a unique combination.  He also has a background in derivatives and other financial instruments.  In short, he could be very interesting for us in supporting Asian activities, but also if you saw a fit within your research group.  I told Niki that I would pass his cv along to you.  Pls let me know if you are able to make contact and see a possibility for him at Enron.  thanks.

__label__Save	Ethylene Margin Collar Model Dear All:   Let us meet early this afternoon.   Here is the overview of the model:  1)The Ethylene margin collars are priced using Asian Spread option.    The forward curve and volatility curve are provided by the desk.   The correlation between the Ethylene and Ethylene cost starts from the   historical spot correlation 50% and grows with the maturity.  2) The overall 40MM payout cap is modeled sepereately.      I fitted the historical spread ( 10 years data ) to a mean reverting model    with stronger mean reverting strength on the floor side.  The model  produces    trajectories that are statistically simular to the historical data.     Then the expected payoff is computed through simulation.   At the meeting we will discuss the assumptions and present the results.

Louise     Christie Patrick 05/21/2001 07:01 PM To: Louise Kitchen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Greg Whalley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Andy Zipper/Enron@EnronXGate cc: Jeffrey A Shankman/Enron@EnronXGate, Vince J Kaminski/Enron@EnronXGate, Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON   Subject: Wharton  Guys--  First of all, Louise, I understand we have a baby??  CONGRATULATIONS!! (details please, at your earliest chance)  Regarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many eMails Ive received concerning Enrons participation--link to the referenced web site for specific agenda; also, Ive received several voice messages from leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  forums (coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in which Enron has invested with Wharton.   The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level.   Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for the professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and other research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research.  Again,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor participation on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate executives on the other side. This is intentionally designed to create a high-level e-think-tank environment for senior level professors and corporate executives.  O.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about??  As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to DIRECTLY increase Enrons favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is intentionally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, references, course work, etc.   A few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enrons involvement in this effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and participate---they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very frequently.......All of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded our minimal involvement-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there someone at Enron, directly involved in Enrons eBusiness initiatives, interested in jumping into this effort and participating?  Do those of you involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense, or the time and expense of one of your senior (at least Director level) people to participate?  Would it be viewed, at least at this time,  simply as an Enron brain drain (Ive received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one business person at Enron).     The bottom line is, Id like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortable telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in the WeBI effort largely at the  financial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at other levels in the future, at Enrons discretion.

__label__DontSave	FW: Changes to PRC Process Happy Friday!  I just wanted to let each of you know that we have cancelled the PRC training on Monday since the majority of the information that we were going to present is outlined below.  However, if any of you need any additional assistance or have any questions, especially if this is your first PRC, please do not hesitate to contact me at  extension 5-7809.    Additionally, please remember to complete your self evaluation and list your 5 accomplishments in PEP, and update your profile in eHRonline, as all of this information will be reviewed during the PRC meeting.  In order to access eHRonline, you will need your personnel number and password.  If you do not have this info, please call the SAP hotline  at 5-4727.  Thanks, Anne Labbe HR Representative  -----Original Message----- From:  Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Announcements_Corp_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Jeff Skilling- President and CEO@ENRON Sent: Wednesday, May 09, 2001 1:55 PM To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON Subject: Changes to PRC Process   MEMORANDUM  TO:  All Employees  FROM: Jeff Skilling  DATE:   May 9, 2001  SUBJECT: Changes to PRC Process  Enrons midyear Performance Review process is now underway.  The PRC system is the backbone of Enrons meritocracy and is a critical part of the process of managing, rewarding, and moving talent.  The system allows us to provide 360-degree feedback on employee performance; to evaluate skill levels across Enron on a relative basis; to align individual performance with compensation decisions; and to inform our staffing decisions.  The PRC process begins when you access the Performance Evaluation Process (PEP) system and suggest reviewers who can best speak about your performance.  Once all the feedback is received, your supervisor will use it to assist in determining your performance relative to your peers in the same job group in a Performance Review Committee meeting.  In the meeting, supervisors make a rating recommendation supported by a description of the individuals performance during the review period and an indication of the feedback received.  The decision of the committee on relative performance must be unanimous for all employees under review.  At the end of last year, we asked you to provide us with feedback on how we could improve the PRC process without compromising the philosophy behind the system.  Based on your comments and suggestions, the PRC Committee and the Enron Policy Committee have agreed upon several modifications that will streamline the process.  These changes include online access to the PEP system through our ClickAtHome portal, shorter forms, changes to the rating system, and the opportunity to provide feedback on your supervisor.  These changes are outlined in detail below.    ? Eligibility - In an effort to ensure that new employees have amassed a sufficient track record and are evaluated appropriately, a minimum of six months tenure at Enron will be required before an employee is included and evaluated in a PRC meeting.  Consequently, employees hired after December 31, 2000, will not be included in the mid-year PRC ratings process.  These employees will nevertheless solicit and receive feedback via the PEP system and must receive a final evaluation from their managers.  Because of the opportunity for rapid development in the Analyst/Associate Program, all Analysts and Associates with a minimum of three months tenure (hired prior to March 1, 2001) will be included and rated in a PRC meeting.   ? Non-exempt Employees - Non-exempt employees (administrative and clerical) will not be rated in a formal PRC meeting.  Individual Business Units or groups may choose to discuss their non-exempt employees, but this is not required.  The sole requirement for non-exempt employees is that they receive a rating of 1-3 (1 and 2 bonus eligible, and 3 not bonus eligible).   They will continue to solicit feedback via the PEP system, and as in the past, they must receive a written final evaluation from their supervisor.   ? Rating Clusters - Last year we used the following descriptors to determine relative rating: superior, excellent, strong, satisfactory, needs improvement and issues.  Many employees believed that these descriptors were not useful in light of the relative evaluation process.  So this year we will use numerical relative ratings of 1-5 (with 1 being the highest).  Those in categories 1-4 are bonus eligible; those in category 5 are not bonus eligible.  For those in category 5, the consequences (besides not receiving a bonus) include implementation of a Development Plan or, in the event of continuing performance issues, consideration of ongoing employment. ? Preferred Distribution - Consistent with the relative rating approach, employees performance will be grouped in accordance with the following distribution:  5% level 1, 30% level 2, 30% level 3, 20% level 4, 15% level 5.  This grouping requires PRC committee members to identify those who must improve in order to remain at Enron as well as to identify top talent for special recognition.  There is flexibility in the system, but every organization must exercise informed discretion to meet a distribution that reflects that organizations overall effectiveness and need for improvement. ? Ensuring higher quality reviews - In the past, employees and their supervisors could select an unlimited number of reviewers.  This approach reduced the quality of the written feedback, with many forms filled out only with rating information.  To ensure higher quality written reviews, the PEP system will limit the number of reviewers an employee may select for feedback to a maximum of 7.  Additionally, the PEP forms have been revised to encourage more written feedback and reduce reliance on ratings. ? Feedback Forms -The 360-degree feedback forms have been reduced to one page; however, the  system will accommodate more detailed written feedback. ? Unsolicited Feedback - In the event an individual is not selected as a reviewer but wants to provide feedback on an employee, he or she may do so via the Unsolicited Feedback feature in PEP.  Unsolicited Feedback is in addition to the maximum of seven reviews. ? Self-evaluation Form - The self-evaluation form has been revised to provide employees with a forum to list their accomplishments during the review period.   The employees list of accomplishments will be available for viewing by the PRC committee during the meeting.   ? Reviewing your supervisor - Employees will have the opportunity to review their supervisors and to rate the effectiveness of their supervisors delivery of feedback. ? Disclosure of Ratings - Disclosure of a rating in cluster 5 is mandatory across the organization; disclosure of ratings in clusters 1-4 is at the supervisors discretion.   ? Access through ClickAtHome - U.S. employees will be able to access and complete feedback and self-evaluation forms through the ClickAtHome portal at www.enron@clickathome.net <http://www.enron@clickathome.net>.  This will provide employees the convenience to complete these forms at home or at the office.  PRC is part of our competitive edge.

__label__DontSave	MS 150 Report Dear  Friends and Family:  It  was Saturday morning at 5:30AM when I arrived at Tully Stadium, the sta= rt for  the MS 150.  The weather was the  warmest of any of the 3 previous = MS 150s I road.  By 6:30AM, 9,000+ riders were lined up  looking forward t= o our 100-mile journey for the day.  This year there was a lot of press  co= verage as the ride was dedicated to Maxine Mesinger.  Maxine, a long time s= ufferer of MS, and  society columnist for the Houston Chronicle, died this = past year of  complications from MS.  British  Petroleum had 580 riders edg= ing out Enron as the first corporate team to go  out.  Enron had the second=  start  with 450 riders and I was among one of the first people out along w= ith the other  Enron top fundraisers including Jeff Skilling, CEO of Enron = and two riders with  MS.  Enron was the top fundraising  team from the 2000=  MS 150.    The  cannon went off and I kicked into high gear.  I flew with the fastest = riders and after  about ? a mile I could not keep up with them.  I was able=  to maintain a speed of 22  miles an hour, crossing the Katy prairie while = the race teams that started  behind us were passing me.  My first  stop was=  break point three, 39 miles into the ride, and 1 hour and 45 minutes  late= r.  The weather was already  feeling hot and humid.  I  replenished my wate= r supply and continued the next 15 miles to lunch.  It was hilly but we sti= ll had a tail  wind.  I arrived at lunch at 10AM in  Bellville, TX, 55 mile= s from the start.   I found the Enron lunch spot with our catered lunch. =   After  a quick lunch I headed up to Industry, TX, population 475, which doe= s not  appreciate 9,000+ riders going though their small town.  You need to=  make sure you stop at the  one stop sign in town or you will get a ticket.=   Luckily there was a police officer  directing traffic, as there was at al= most all intersections along the route of  country roads.  I made my third = stop  of the day in Industry at breakpoint five, where I had to stretch.   = The hills were getting harder and  the tail wind was now a crosswind.   Com= ing up on breakpoint seven 90 miles on route, a truck and crosswind  almost=  blew the bikes off the road.   The sign said it was now 7.6 miles to the f= inish of the day.  The next 7.6 miles were fine, but it was  an additional = 3 miles to the finish with hills and a strong head  wind  Last  year I upgraded to a new bike with a triple.  I was able to keep a sl= ow but steady  pace up the hills by getting into the granny gear.  I arrive= d in La Grange, TX at 2:20PM, 7  hours and 20 minutes later to many cheerin= g supporters.   I was done for Day 1!  I  headed over to the Enron tent, the largest tent in La Grange.  After che= cking in, I gulped two large  bottles of ice water, and signed-in for a mas= sage.  Enron had 30 massage therapists working  to sooth the tired and wear= y riders.   After my massage I felt totally relaxed.  Ilene found me in the=  Enron tent having  a beer.  It took Ilene about an hour  to find me since = our cell phones did not work well in La Grange due to limited  cell capacit= y.  Every year Enron has  a large barbeque in the Enron tent and this year = the food was even better.  While in the tent I was talking to some  other E= nron riders and I learned that some came in as early as  10:45AM!  The  next morning at 4:45AM, it was time to get up.  Ilene and I arrived at=  the fairgrounds  at 5:30AM.  I headed over to  hydration station to refill=  my water bottles and stretched before the 7:00AM  start.  I was one of the=  first 50  people in line.  At exactly 7AM, we  were let out; normally we a= re delayed for fog.  It was warmer than the day before and we  had more hil= ls ahead of us.  The first 20 miles  were relatively uneventful except I was able to carry o= n 20-minute conversation  with Jeff Skilling, CEO of Enron.   Then came the=  downhill where you can reach speeds over 40 mph without  trying, the park = is now only 3 miles away.   The park has a very hilly, curvy, and dangerous=  route lasting 10  miles.  I stopped right inside the  park to refill water=  and get some snacks.   I was really glad that I had the new bike with the = triple, as I was able  to get up hills with little effort while others were=  struggling or walking their  bikes.  That was until killer hill,  which I = did not remember being too difficult.  After the downhill there was the  up= hill.  I tried to shift into that  wonderful granny gear but it was too lat= e.   I noticed the pedaling was extremely easy and I was slowing almost to = a  stop.  I looked down at my chain and  it jumped off the gear.  I yelled =  oh no!  I was able to get my foot  out and prevent myself from falling. =   The hill I fell on years past was easy.  I headed out of the park to lunc= h at the  50-mile point, it was 10AM.  When I  pulled into lunch I saw Ilen= e who was working the lunch, she was very happy to  see me and I was happy = to see her.   I took a short break and headed out to Austin.  After lunch, the cloud cover  was gone and it was hot.  I stopped  twice in=  the remaining 35 miles for water.   The last 15 miles were into the wind o= r with a very strong cross  wind.  At approximately 12:30PM,  five hours an= d thirty minutes later, I pulled into the finish line with many  supporters=  cheering the riders on.   I saw Ilene several minutes after I arrived.  I = was elated that I completed the  175-mile ride from Houston to Austin for t= he 4th time and now I was ready for a  beer or two and some lunch.  This years ride was  magnificent!   It was a real  pleasure to see several=  people with MS ride the bike tour.  The law enforcement personnel directin= g  traffic was helpful as they kept safe and us moving.  The support staff = and volunteers that  provided water and food at breakpoints and lunch were = awesome.  Not to mention Ilene supporting me all  the way to Austin!  I wou= ld also  like to thank my donors that have helped me raise over $21,000 for=  MS and I am  still counting.  I would like to see  this number reach $30,0= 00 towards a cure for MS.  If you still would like your  contribution to help send a check by May 11 i= t should be made out to the  National MS Society and sent to the address be= low or drop it by 2604A in  the Enron building.

As you know, the current plan is to transfer 4 meteorologists from my group and 2 pure quants to the new company. I have no commitments from the pure quant side at this point, so I cannot give you any specific names.

__label__DontSave	Follow-up and Questions Vince,   1) Did you talk to Whalley about Christian Werner?  I am sure that the is going to be calling in the next few days, and will want to know the status of his employment with Enron.   2) As you know Stephen Bennett would like to go to Rices Executive MBA program.  In light of everything that is going on, do you still want to fund this?  The cost is 65K for two years, and we will need to submit a letter of nomination on Enron letterhead signed by a senior exec agreeing to do the following: 1) provide full financial support for the nominee, payable at the beginning of each academic year, and 2) Schedule the Nominees work and travel requirements to permit regular class attendance, including the international trip, and completion of class assignments.   Steve would like to attend in the fall, and apps are due in the beginning of 2002, so we just need to work on this, if you agree to pay for it.

__label__DontSave	Research Support Vince,  Just let you know crack spread option trading is peaking up volumes.  I will arrange a meeting for discussion of support.   Zimin   -----Original Message----- From:  De La Ossa, Mario   Sent: Wednesday, October 24, 2001 5:05 PM To: Lu, Zimin; Lee, Bob Subject: Research Support  I attended a derivatives seminar put on by the Lacima Group.  It appears to me that this group has modeling expertise that could accelerate our progress towards properly modeling correlation and forward volatility dependent options.  I have spoken with Bob Lee on this issue.  I am already trading a relatively large (1000+ contracts) crack spread options book and a modest time spread options book.  I am planning to expand our activity in these markets through Enron Online.  Also, I would like to start trying to develop markets in contingent premium options on heating oil and jet fuel.  To do this, I need research help in implementing a consistent approach to modeling forward forward volatility, especially with regard to heating oil (seasonality).  I would like to discuss this in greater detail to scope the next step forward.  Thanks, Mario.

__label__DontSave	Expected Future Curve Demand Vince, based on the email below, it looks as if the curve demand for June-July could be heavy, based on the extensive review of international assets taking place in August.  FYI --- Gwyn   -----Original Message----- From:  Hudler, Cindy   Sent: Monday, May 14, 2001 9:56 AM To: Raymond, Maureen Cc: Koepke, Gwyn Subject: Curve request  Gwyn,  Did you receive my voice mail message regarding the monthly request for updates to the curves for the Brazil office?  I feel this should stand as a recurring monthly request as long as they hold the positions which must be revalued each month.  If I recall correctly, they need:  FX    IGP-M    CPI (include monthly data)    PPI  Finished Goods  (include monthly data)    PPI Industrial Commodities  (include monthly data)  What is your status on the preparation of these curves?  We will be revaluing assets extensively for the next BOD meeting (August) so I will prepare a list of curves needed for the next several months.  Please let me know about the curves for Riccardo.  Thanks again!  Cindy Koepke, Gwyn koepke@enron.com enron.com Kaminski j.kaminski@enron.com

__label__Save	Kirstees role in London Vince:  This is precisely the concern I have for Kirstee.  Steve tells me that she is  very imaginative and eager to try to add value, but she has no local  supervisor to help push some of her ideas.  I will give you an update of our  discussion later and solicit your suggestions.  Grant. ---------------------- Forwarded by Grant Masson/HOU/ECT on 07/25/2000 09:07  AM ---------------------------   Kirstee Hewitt 07/25/2000 08:48 AM To: Grant Masson/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Meeting today  Hi Grant - as Anjam has set up a meeting for 9:30 your time how about we try  and talk afterwards. Originally we said 10:00 your  time but I guess that the MG meeting will take longer than half an hour. Are  you free around 10:30  your time ?  I think some of the communication problems I originally had with Anjam have  been resolved (although it was a difficult situation to interpret) however, I  would very much like to discuss the situation that I am in concerning my  immediate management.  I have felt that over the last month I have been floundering a little and  have not really been able to turn to anyone in London for direction  concerning VaR (although as expected Steve has been very helpful to give me  an idea on how to proceed theoretically). I do have many of my own ideas  although I think I need to obtain some kind of authority to start any  substantial work. At the moment I feel like I am doing a lot of small things  and am worried that at some stage someone is going to ask the question -  What exactly does she do over there in Research ???  I have talked to Rodrigo  Lamas (RAC model validation new hire) and he has  helped me to focus on some points I had already made.  As a quick summary I have drawn up a memo which outlines some of the points I  think need to be addressed as far as the VaR model is concerned (I could do a  similar memo for the Credit Reserve model but to start have focused my  comments on Market Risk). It is a bit rough and ready (pls excuse any appalling spelling mistakes!) but  I think it will help you to see what I have been thinking about since I have  been here.    I do think that the most important issue is that concerning the origin of the  vol/price curves and how they are constructed.   Cheers Kirstee Grant Masson grant.masson@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com 
__label__Save	Storage modeling John,  I want to thank you for your compliment to the work that we have done for the  Liberty  County Storage facility valuation.   You and your talented associate Ms. Tian gave me a lot of valuable insights  to understand all the aspects of the deal, so it was also a great learning experience for me.    If you think the Research can help you in any way to your deals,  storage,  transport, MTBE, real options,  or whatever,  just let me know, we will get the job done.

__label__Save	Sharads Houston visit Sharad  As expected we didnt get time to discuss in detail what to do in Houston.   We have discussed the subject informally, but Im laying it out here for  clarity, and for Vince/Stinsons information.  Here are my thoughts:  1. Exotica.  This is the top priority, as youd rightly identified yourself.  a. Learn how to build xlls.  b. Catalogue functions in Houston Exotica not yet available in London.  c. Catalogue differences between inputs to London and Houston Exotica  functions.  d. Produce London xll that allows current function calls to be used where  possible, and incorporates new functions.  e. Update documentation as appropriate.  If you do nothing else in your two weeks, Ill be very happy with this.   Main contacts are Paulo and Zimin.  2. Understand American Monte Carlo (AMC).  The aim is to get a feel for AMCs  characteristics.  Before we embark on the use of AMC for real option  valuation, Id like to understand how it behaves for financial options.  I  suggest something like the following:  a. Produce AMC code for single GBM for American option.  Compare Greeks  against those from appropriate tree methods.  b. Two GBM spread option model, to compare against 1-d numerical integration  method.  Although the American bit of AMC isnt going to be used here, it  will be interesting to think about the bucketing issue in price/payoff space  and, again, the Greeks.  c. Some form of mean reverting model, preferably two factor.  d. HJM for pure financial option valuation.  If you get somewhere on a-d, and AMC behaves sensibly on pure financial  models, then Ill be very keen to roll it out for real option valuations.  Vince/Stinson - since Im expecting the worst from IT i.t.o. email support,  would you be good enough to print this email out and hand it to Sharad?

This list will be used to solicit the interest of  researchers and graduate students who would then work under our supervision.    While the details of how this effort will be organized are still largely up  in the air (list of financial institutions, reporting structure, financial  considerations, confidentiality agreements, exchange of seminars and short  courses, etc) we are making an attempt to define our common interests.  Such  areas are: Econophysical (e.g. market development; how weather expectations shape the  market; etc.) Product development (e.g. agriculture and weather; solar radiation and  telecommunications, the Jet stream and Airlines; etc.) Analytical/Mathematical/Simulation efforts (building a MC simulation for any  given problem might fall under here; working with incomplete data sheets/ways  for filling in data holes; etc.) Purely weather (e.g. a statistical analysis of the long term effects of solar  phenomena on weather would enter this category)  In light of the above and within the next couple of days,I would like to ask  you to provide me with problem statements within these areas that you have an  interest in and which might offer themselves to this kind of collaboration.   At this point, were brainstorming; we would thus be happy to have even the  sketchiest of ideas and have the weakest of expectations for well formulated  projects.

I apologize for making numerous requests but everything that you have provided us will be useful to SSB.     SSB has been provided with some information.  They will be incorporating the information that you have provided as well as information from the traders in their board presentations.  At this stage, I believe that we have done all that we can.  If I hear something further, I will let you know on Monday.   Again, thank you very much for all of your help.

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.  As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by  AAs Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who  led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover  gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study  itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.   Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the  questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very  useful.    I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for  passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the  person that has contacted you.

Other companies analysts say are saddled with hedges include El Paso Energy  Corp. and Coastal Corp., which are merging.   A Coastal official declined to comment on the companys forward positions.   Although El Paso is known for its pipeline business, it produces gas as  result of its $6.2 billion acquisition last year of Sonat. More than 90  percent of that gas is hedged through the rest of the year, said Bruce  Connery, vice president of investor relations. The forward contracts are for  $2.40, he said.   Hedging in the current market plays to the companys primary aim of meeting  investors expectations, Connery said.

Several of them, however, do contain  innovations.          I have asked Ms. De Claris to  forward a copy to you.       As I expressed to you earlier I  am particularly interested in Enron Credit Swaps trading platform and the  business opportunities that it will spawn.       I also think that there are  tremendous opportunities to be explored in the secondary mortgage maket in the  US. I do not know if Enron has considered or is active in this market. This  would be an area that I am also very interested and in which I think much better  can be done than most of the players in the street.       The question in my mind  (hopefully not prematurely) is: If there is interest here would Enron  consider letting me put together this business?       I look forward to hearing from  you soon.

Apart  from clarifying the timeliness, or lack thereof, of the published  state-specific wellhead production estimates, he indicates their scientists  find severe weather in the fields (freezes, hurricanes) to be a far more  significant issue in production, and in wellhead prices, than is severe  weather in the Northeast, for instance.

__label__Save	Re: Progress Steve,  Thanks a lot. I think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards  understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem (for example, complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality) into the  code.  Regarding Tanyas attitude. Just a few points.   1. I dont think she has the skills to do the system administrators work and she does not have the necessary privileges. This explains why she keeps asking Winston for help.  Its not that the work is beneath her.  2. Some members of Tanyas team came to me complaining about Winston. He effectively told them to go away and work on the research projects and that he would take care of the IT issues. I dont think that its just  Tanyas issue, though I agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful.  3. The reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat  on  Tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and/or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run. They could not care less about the demarcation line between IT and Research. They also want Tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code.  The bottom line is that we are in full agreement: Tanya and Winston have to work as a team and I shall work on my end to make sure that  it happens. Credit is emerging as a critical issue for Enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail.  Vince     From: Stephen Stock/ENRON@enronXgate on 01/11/2001 08:23 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Progress   Vince,  I got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking  about some specific solutions to performance of IT systems... In particular  distributed processing. Also I heard that you had concerns about the use of  multiple languages etc....  Both of these sound like what I was discussing with you on previous  occasions... Do you feel the need to discuss these further?  The multi-language issue isnt really that much of an issue, as the current  system is 98% java right now. Although I am a big fan of C/C++(it is my main  development skill) , I am also very aware that Java is a much more evolved  and robust language. I had serious doubts about the performance, but Ive had  a review conducted, and the results are showing the Sun Unix implementation  to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than C/C++ because of something  they call Hot-Spot technology. (its an instruction caching technique, I  believe). The concerns I expressed to you, were really about how technical  people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively  meaningless metric like portability.  On the issue of distributed processing... the original review I had conducted  by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution, and as Zhiyong Wei  is already working on Global Valuation project, Winston is actively working  with Zhiyong to see if he can model the VaR architecture on that, and also to  find a common Valuation piece between the systems.  Id like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some  time over the next few days?  Also, I sat in on the Tanya / Winston meeting yesterday and as per our  discussion at the elevator, I attempted to help her argument by suggesting to  all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code... I.e.  Seperating research domain problems from IT problems.  She said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could  get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were. I asked her how she would  measure that, and she said she would instrument the code manually by  inserting timing elements at strategic points. I mentioned that a profiling  tool could probably do this job for her. Tanya again said that stepping  through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code, and that  studying documentation wasnt enough.   About 6 weeks ago, I commissioned a team to document the system down to  psuedo-code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon.  (in fact Ive asked for a draft copy to be given to Tanya right now), and  Winston is also working on a draft Research/IT working together document,  which will identify how the exchange of information takes place.  Tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated IT developer to do  all the environment setup for her, because she doesnt really want to have to  do that. I think that this is probably the root cause of the issue. The IT  guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good, as  it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her. She is  claiming that they are un-cooperative.... they are claiming that she  continually asks the same questions about set-up over and over again, and  doesnt seem to want to learn how to do it. Winston on the other hand, could  be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and  an IT issue and ask for help from research.  I think you Debbie and I need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely.  I have asked Tanya and Winston to go ahead and work very closely together  over the next few days....and Debbie Brackett and I will review their  progress on Friday.   In the meantime lll be looking at setting up a working test environment that  doesnt involve my main Quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer  term solution.

Enron is not currently in the business of developing or manufacturing  electrical generation equipment and does not plan, as far as I know, to enter  this business.   The one exception is our ownership in entities developing  wind and solar, renewable energy.  2.  Enron does not have the proper facilities or expertise to test or develop  Mr. Pattesons proposed generator.  3.  There could be substantial risk in testing this generator as it would  involve boiling of a flammable material under pressure.  4.  I do not believe that the proposed generator will produce any significant  quantity of electrical power.   The generator produces power by induction.   That is, electric current is induced by a changing magnetic field.   The  mechanism powering the changing magnetic field is the movement of magnetic  dipoles which are suspended in a boiling medium.   As the boiling will  produce a somewhat random movement of the liquid, the movement or change in  the magnetic field will be highly random and thus not suitable for producing  a steady or reliable electrical current.  I have asked Martin Lin to also review the documents to render an independent  opinion of this proposal.  Respectfully,  Dr. Stinson Gibner PhD. Physics VP Research, Enron North America  P.S.   Kevin and Zimin:  If you have any interest in reviewing Mr. Pattesons  proposal, please let me know.

__label__DontSave	RE: Neptune -- merchant transmission Thanks Vince... Well be auctioning off transmission rights in these corridors in September (assuming FERC approves our filing), which confronts traders with a complex array of valuation problems (the long-term value of the right to ship energy along these DC pathways and to collect ancillary services in each of the markets). Its a conceptually difficult challenge for most companies but Im sure Enron is all over it. Well be interested in whether or not Enrons traders participate in this auction.  We are also pre-selling some of the capacity in negotiations over the summer, in the expectation of FERC approval of that concept (kind of an anchor tenant concept).  As you will recall, we did approach Enron early on in the project (a fellow in Calgary whose name I cannot remember) and he indicated no interest. Ill keep you in the loop because I suspect youll find the intellectual challenge intriguing -- what is access to DC capacity worth? --- as I do.  Hope things are going well in all of your markets!

__label__DontSave	The PDA roundup NETWORK WORLD NEWSLETTER: NEAL WEINBERG on PRODUCT REVIEWS  11/27/01 - Todays focus: The PDA roundup Dear Wincenty Kaminski,  In this issue:  * The best in PDA devices and accessories * Links related to Network World product reviews * Featured reader resource ____________________________________________________________ HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDE  If youre looking for a gift for that special network executive, or if youre a network executive looking for gifts for your family or friends, odds are weve played with, errr, tested a device that could do the trick. Check out our Holiday Gift Guide to help make this years shopping easier! http://nww1.com/go/ad206.html  ____________________________________________________________ Todays focus: The PDA roundup  By Neal Weinberg  The Reviewmeister spends most of the year testing out heavy duty networking gear. But with the holidays on the horizon, we thought it would be appropriate to look into some tech tools you might want to put on your holiday shopping list.  Our first category is the personal digital assistant (PDA). If youre still using a Palm III, its time for an upgrade.  Hewlett-Packards Jornada 565 Pocket PC is an option. At $600, this model features a color screen, is wireless-ready and has new enterprise features such as VPN connectivity.  If youre looking for multimedia features, the Sony Clie PEG- N610C lets you view color photos and movies, uses Memory Stick for storage and costs about $400.  The Handspring Visor Pro, at $300, offers twice as much memory as other Palm OS devices and the fastest processor. If you want to put lots of applications on a PDA, buy this one.  If youre looking for a starter PDA for friends and relatives, check out the Handspring Visor Neo, a $200 model that offers a fast processor and the Springboard expansion slot for add-on modules.  The @migo PD-600c Pocket PC is the only one with a PC Card slot. Its great for wireless LAN cards, Bluetooth cards or storage cards, and costs $500.  The best high-end Palm is the m505, a $450 model that comes with a color screen and expansion slot for Secure Digital or MultiMedia Cards. Its the Palm to have for the Palm junkie (for the moment).  * PDA accessories  If you want to take your Palm wireless, check out the Xircom wireless LAN module for Palm m500 series. At $300, it offers a snap-on cradle that gives wireless LAN (802.11b) access to the Palm m500 or m505.  Hows this for an accessory: The $120 Akron Networks Parafone PRF500 turns your Handspring Visor into a 900MHz cordless phone for use around the house. Its charging stand doubles as a HotSync cable.  The Seiko Thumboard, at $40, is a keyboard for Handspring Visors, Palm V/Vx and m500 series. It snaps onto the PDAs sync port, covering up the writing area.  Also check out the Acer Accufeel G300. For between  $40 and $50, its a keyboard that snaps onto a Palm V; best for use with e-mail and long document inputs.  And for $75, theres the Belkin Pocket PDA Keyboard, a tiny fold-out keyboard that is compatible with many different Palm models (III, V, VII, m100) because of its PDA-One adapter. With the adapter, its a bit tricky to configure, but once its working, its a pretty cool keyboard.

__label__Save	Re: CreditDotCom Projects Amitava,  Can you schedule a brainstorming session with Vasant, Tanya, Rakesh, myself and Ben (if possible)?   What about the trip on Monday. Has it been scheduled?   Vince      Amitava Dhar@ENRON 01/03/2001 08:30 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ben Parsons/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: CreditDotCom Projects  The following is a good summary from Vasant about the projects and what is  ahead of us. Ben, please let me know when things are ready; I can plan my trip accordingly. Thanks,  Amitava    EnronCredit.com is working on 3 main models --- the FMC model, the Placement  model, and the Movement model. FMC Model : provides credit default swap price curves for 16 ratings with 33  industry offsets.  Each day, this model takes the previous days trader  curves and adjusts them for the movement in Bloomberg yields and observed  swap prices. Placement Model : uses linear regression to credit default swap prices using  dummified ranges for Market Capitalization, Liquidity, KMV Score, etc.  One  main issue here is that the dataset is biased towards investment grade  names.  Alternate approaches looked at developing separate models for  separate sunsets of names. Movement Model : provides an alert system for news.  This is under  development.  Current involvement of Houston Research Group members is in the  development/modifications of the Placement Model, especially in thinking  through the various single vs multi model approaches.  We can help in the  brainstorming for better models for subsets.  One main project right now is  to get a separate model for subsidiaries, and to exclude subsidiary names  from the main regression.

__label__DontSave	FW: Sloan Leadership Conference Billy,    In light of the recent misstep with MIT, do you think we should try to send a senior Enron rep to the Sloan Leadership conference on October 27?  Vince Kaminski is probably the right person to attend.  Regards,  Tom     -----Original Message----- From:  Keyur Patel <keyur@MIT.EDU>@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22Keyur+20Patel+22+20+3Ckeyur+40MIT+2EEDU+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  Sent: Wednesday, September 12, 2001 8:37 PM To: Gros, Thomas D. Subject: Sloan Leadership Conference  Tom, Before I left my summer internship at Enron, I sent you a message regarding the Sloan Leadership Conference (see below).  The conference will be held on Saturday, October 27.  We would like to invite you to be on the Finance panel.  I can also work with you if you want to be involved in other aspects of the conference. It would be great if you could offer the conference participants your unique experiences in bringing new products to market.  I think you have the perfect background for this panel, and I am very excited about the opportunity to have you on the panel.  I have included the thesis statement for the finance panel below.  Also, I have not heard back from HR about their interest in the conference. I think this is a great opportunity for Enron to spread its message to a targeted audience.  The sponsor memo is attached.  If you would be interested in sponsoring this conference, please let me know as soon as possible.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.  I will call you as soon as I can concerning the conference.  Thanks, Keyur Patel MIT Sloan MBA Class of 2002 617-290-3703 (Mobile) keyur@mit.edu (E-Mail)  FINANCE PANEL THESIS The finance panel will focus on innovation in finance, specifically in accessing capital, valuation techniques, new product development, and product distribution.  From a corporate perspective the focus will be on innovative ways of both accessing capital, given the recent scarcity in the traditional equities market, and valuing businesses.  From a financial institutions perspective the focus will be on new products and new distribution channels.  Beyond addressing the issues faced by their companies, the panelists can/should also discuss specific leadership strategies financial managers need to employ in difficult times.   ----Original Message Follows---- From: Keyur Patel <KPatel2@enron.com> To: William R Lemmons <William_R_Lemmons@enron.com> CC: Thomas D Gros <Thomas_D_Gros.EnronXGate@enron.com>,        Traci Warner <Traci_Warner.enronXgate@enron.com> Subject: MIT Sloan Opportunities Date: Tue, 21 Aug 2001 16:39:32 -0500    Mr. Lemmons, When we met with you regarding the Enron/MIT Sloan relationship, you mentioned that Enron was interested in narrowing the search for talent by targeting specific programs at schools that are more in line with Enrons goals.  We would like to present 2 programs at MIT Sloan that would be ideal for Enron and will produce a more effective recruiting approach.  The two programs are the MIT Sloan Leadership Conference (which will feature a Finance and Innovation panel) and the brand new Energy & Environmental Finance Club.  MIT SLOAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE (See attached file: Sponsor_Memo.doc)(Sponsor Memo is Attached)  The conference is a student-led initiative that has drawn successful leaders from various industries around the world.  We recognize that leadership is not something that can be taught in the course of one day.  However, we hope to draw upon the practical experiences of some of todays most recognized leaders to help guide us toward our own personal leadership styles, and to educate us about the kinds of issues that we may face as leaders ourselves in the future.  This years Conference, Critical Choices: Defining Moments of Leadership, addresses the difficult decisions that leaders face in an evolving environment, and the development of organizational leadership to successfully manage these decisions.   The conference will feature Ben Zander, the conductor of the Boston Philharmonic.  He performs around the world, teaches at the New England Conservatory, and speaks to corporations and other organizations on leadership. Furthermore, several panels focusing on leadership in specific industries will be held.  The finance panel will focus on Finance and Innovation, and will discuss the leadership challenges of bringing innovation to an industry that has been relatively status quo.   - Sponsor_Memo.doc Gros, Thomas D. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=TGROS> d..gros@enron.com enron.com Lemmons Jr. billy.lemmons@enron.com Kaminski j.kaminski@enron.com

__label__Save	Re: Steve Leppard Dale,  My recommendation is to make Steve the head of the research unit in London. We were talking originally about September but I think we should accelerate  this process. Of course, Anjam will be very unhappy about it, but we cannot manage around  him any longer.  I think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase. I would like to offer him a significant increase that goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility. A salary increase will also bring him closer to the market.  We see the market for  technical people going through the roof in  practically every location where we operate.  A contract is not a good solution in my view. It creates a sense of false  security for both an employee and the company.  I shall send a message to John Sherriff with my recommendation. I shall cc  you. I would appreciate if you could bring it up with John as well.  Vince       Dale Surbey 07/11/2000 10:23 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Steve Leppard  Hi Vince,  HR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a  noticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to  pay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with  a potential gap - particularly in light of what were seeing in our quant  recruiting effort for credit trading and research.  Id like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and  keep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:  1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  Im not  sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token  salary increase.  2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for  making Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to  EBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy  and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at  year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater  responsibility.  3)  We have some people that were trying to get under long-term (3-yr)  contract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of  these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.   Weve not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer  to keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually  binding him to the job.  Id value your thoughts on this.  Thanks,  Dale Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com enron.com Dale Surbey dale.surbey@enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com

The assumptions are numerous to list here -- so I list below only the major ones. 1.  Underlyings in Natgas with a flat term structure -- $ 3.0 per MMBtu 2.  A reasonable volatility term structure has been assumed 3.  A representative set of 20 counterparties of various credit ratings selected on the basis of their MTM position on a random day this year. 4. The reported capital required is for a month and so is the VAR number 5. The volumetric exposure for each counterparty was assumed to be proportional to the MTM position on the same date as in item3. 6. We started with a premise of zero MTM, zero collateral at the starting time  and zero threshold for margin calls all through. 7. The volume is distributed evenly between financial and physical contracts and across 60 forward months 8. No distinction has been made between physical and financial contracts 9. The margin calls are assumed to be a function of the exposure times a factor which varies from 0 to 1 as credit rating goes from AAA to D  The results are therefore .... 1.  the unnormalized results illustrate the trend of capital required with the volume multiplier but the absolute magnitude of the capital required is tied to the simulated VAR and hence to the underlying volume level assumed.  If you have anymore questions please feel to call Karthik Rajan, Tanya Tamarchenko or myself.

We would be happy to work with the right  person to update the ERMS code in order to close this discrepancy.   Please  let me know how you would like to proceed.

__label__Save	Non-firm power curve building Hi Vince,   Amitava and I have received a request to build a non-firm power curve for each region from David Hoogs Double Trigger folks.  The objective, as they explain it, is to allow the Desk to buy non-firm from the market, buy Davids outage product, and sell firm to the market.  Accountants would like a curve to mark the non-firm position.  My initial thought is that the desk should provide this non-firm curve, but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in David Hoogs court to build the curve if David wants to sell his product internally to the desk.    Assuming we build the curve, the next issue is how to define non-firm?  The only way I can think of is to tie the non-firmness to a specific generation unit or group of units.  This will allow the purchase of Davids outage product to cover the non-firmness risk.  Tying the definition of non-firmness to a whole region seems implausible --- what does it mean to give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem anywhere in the region?  Consequently, the non-firm curve takes on a unit-level interpretation, and not a region-level interpretation.  Consequently, I do not see how we can talk about the non-firm curve for the region?  We will need to build a non-firm curve for each generation unit or group of units.  Maybe I could get your thoughts later today.

__label__Save	Interview - Numerical Methods & Finance Dear  Tanya:                It was a  great pleasure to have met you. I very much enjoyed the interview and your  insightfull questions.           I am keenly  aware that many of the methods that I discussed with you yesterday are unique,  new and not reported elsewhere. This is true both about the work I did in  whole yield curve interest rate pricing as well as GARCH. The innovations  stem from the extensive numerical analysis experience that I have both in  turbulence physics as well as finance. They entailed considering the problem  from its raw formulation, mathematical analysis, physical interpretation,  taylored numerical method development, software writting and develoment and data  management.           As to why I  have not yet published anything the answer is that the driver in my work has  been adding value to the business not publishing. Publishing is however an  option that has always been open with my former supervisor who is aware of the  work that I did.           I not however  that these results were possible only by exploring to the utmost extent the  mathematics, finance, software design and data managemnet aspects of the  problem. Absence of any of these aspects is likely to cripple performance and  execution.           Please recall  that as good as they were the performance measures that I mentioned to you were  for a single processor machine. Vastly better can be achieved with both soft  parallelism (multithreading) as well as hard parallelism (heterogenous network).  This fo course allows us to step up the reach of the models used.           In fact I  know for a fact that better can be done than what I mentioned in the interview.  From work that I have been doing on the integration of the swaption volatility  surface on the whole yield curve interest rate model ITM and OTM instruments can  be included in both the callibration, pricing and hedging.            I look  forward hearing back from you soon and particularly to the opportunity of us  cooperating.

__label__Save	Petrochem Desk I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that theyd only been around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.     From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

__label__Save	New Volatility Curve Generator for UK Power We have established a set of power volatility curves down to the EFA/monthly  level of detail that can be marked to market up to 6 years out.  Beyond this,  the volatility decays to what we understand to be the long-term level for  power volatility, given our understanding of the behaviour of forward prices  over large time-scales.  The swaption traders can now fit the first 5-6 years of the volatility curve  to the market-observed baseload swaption implied volatilities (typically 3 to  12 months duration for the underlying swap) and then be in a good position to  price other swaptions (including swaptions on individual EFA slots)  consistent with the curve.  There may also be an impact on the daily VaR  calculation.  An illustration of the current volatility curves is pasted below:-     These curves will be reset as the market moves, and allow a mark-to-market  approach to be followed for our volatility book.

The Demise of Enron is a bit risky, given that this drama is  still unfolding and the legal ramifications are still uncertain. Maybe you can  change the topic to Energy Markets: Is There Life after Enron? The person  who can cover this topic is either Richard Stavros or Mark Hand. They have  recently published articles in Public Utilities Fortnightly on this topic --  they are both editors working for this magazine. If you cannot locate these  articles, I can fax you the copies.  Vince    - Speaker details.doc VKaminski@aol.com@ENRON vkaminski@aol.com aol.com Kaminski j.kaminski@enron.com

__label__Save	Removal of Caps on Resale of Transmission On March 16, Martin Lin will be participating in a panel discussion with Dick  ONeill of FERC, a rep. of Morgan Stanley, and Ed Cazalet of APX on Market  Turmoil, Trading and Risk Management (Harvard Electricity Group).  At the  present time, except in several limited regions, marketers do not have the  ability to hedge transmission risk by reselling it above cost.  Last year, we  approached Dick ONeills staff about the possibility of lifting the cap on  resales of transmission, but they were not inclined to proceed absent the use  of certain restrictions.  There have been several recent developments in  power and gas, as discussed in the attached memo.  It would be helpful for  Martin to discuss these recent orders as necessary in order to attempt to  gain support from Dick ONeill for the idea of lifting the cap for power.   After Martins discussion, we should consider reapproaching FERC to seek  approval.

__label__Save	Template for pricing the right of first refusal Shelley and Chris,  I have set up a template for pricing ROFRs.  The ROFR is priced as a series  forward start options.  A forward start option gives the holder the right to exercise the option but  the strike price is set at the money in future before the option expiration.  The feature  mimics the matching the best bid in the ROFR.  The underlying for the option is the best bid, which should  be closely related to the price differential between the two hubs that the pipeline connects. Therefore  the ROFR is case dependent, as Vince pointed out.  The volatility can be estimated from the best bid  price history.   With these inputs we can estimate the value of ROFR.  If you have any  questions concerning the model please feel free to call me or Vince.

__label__Save	Yen Outlook Vince,  As a followup to our meeting with David Port and Rudi Zipter re Enrons investment in SK-Enron, Maureen and I wrote the attached position paper on the Japanese Yen.  As we have discussed, the volatility of the won closely tracks fluctuation in the yen, and this yen position paper is intended to complement the won outlook piece for a broader perspective on currencies that takes into account the yens influence on asian currencies. .    We would like to distribute this outlook to David and Rudi, but wanted to send it to you for initial reaction prior to internal distribution.

Saudis sold Cal 00 naphtha at $8 M/T over the Platts AG mean and the  Kuwaitis are offer their naphtha at $11 M/T over the mean.  ENOC offered 700,000 tons of term naphtha and only sold 200,000 tons. ADNOCs splitters should add even more naphtha supplies to the market. Koch has closed their Rotterdam splitter due to poor economics. Not  necessarily a permanent shutdown. He expects the Brent/Dubai spread to return to more normal $1-$1.25/barrel. Regarding condensate he predicts that actual demand will drive the market and  there will be less bottomfeeding by the Japanese and other refiners. He does  feel         the new splitters will reduce the worldwide volumes available,  but that there will still be adequate supplies.  He thinks crack spreads for refiners will still be weak during Cal 00. Although some resid demand will be displaced by natural gas or LNG, he  expects fairly stable differentials to crude. He expects strong US gasoline demand, but limits his demand growth projection  to 1% for the year. Margaret Carson margaret.carson@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com

__label__DontSave	Outline of commitments Remi, Dave:   First of all I want to thank you for your hospitality and to apologize for a delay in responding to you. It was quite a tumultuous week and the turbulence continues.  The outline of commitments with the information on what I have done to  jumpstart the process.  1. Review of the CEPEL model / simplified model. Chonawee started the review process, with the help of our two native Portuguese speakers. Less complicated/faster to run model will follow.  2. SDDP. As you know Tom Halliburton is in Norway this week. They put their grimy fingers on him first. He will be back next week and will help you  to set up the SDDP runs. He even volunteer to stay on the job for a few days longer to help you with the project.  3. Transmission modeling. Martin Lin will call Dave to jumpstart the process.  4. Zimin will call David regarding swing option model, option pricing models for non-standard distributions and truncated distributions.  5. Cooperation with the SA University in the area of the weather research   Remains to be discussed with Jose and Mike.

__label__DontSave	European Gas Watch Consumption and Supply Database - CERA Report Title: European Gas Watch Consumption and Supply Database URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2387    The Fundamentals--Demand Influenced by Power Prices?  The outturn of demand for gas in OECD Europe in 2000 was 484.6 Bcm (billion cubic meters), 2.0 percent above the previous years level of 441.1 Bcm. This was a strong performance, supported by continued switching to gas in power generation in Italy and Spain. But despite the relatively strong performance, several countries recorded a decline--Germany and Netherlands in particular. Gas demand appears to have declined in countries where power prices are low. Companies shut-in production of electricity by cogeneration and bought from the grid, decreasing overall gas demand. Electricity trade increased between Germany and the Netherlands, with low electricity prices in Germany lowering overall electricity production from gas in the Netherlands. The total quarter- on-quarter growth in the third and fourth quarters was due entirely to the underlying increase in demand for gas for power generation.  Residential--First quarter demand was strong with colder weather over the same period in 1999. Temperatures were high in the fourth quarter, dampening residential demand. The continued increase in connections to the grid in most of Europe maintained residential, commercial, and small industrial consumption despite some warm weather patches throughout the winter.  Industrial--Industrial demand was strong throughout the year, particularly in countries with strong economic growth during 2000--France, Spain, and Belgium.  Power generation--Dry weather in the first quarter of 2000 led to an increased use of gas in power generation switching from hydropower. However, in some countries--Italy, for example--wet weather increased hydro output, decreasing gas demand in the fourth quarter. Overall fourth quarter demand in the power generation sector was sustained by incremental new, gasfired capacity that had come onstream.  **end**  Follow above URL for updated demand and supply data.

__label__Save	Re: Energy Derivatives Hi Vince,  Hope all is well with you. Im looking forward to seeing you again next week and meeting with Grant. Can you guys do me  favour? Im sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively (all of them!) to my request for some feedback on the book. Chapter 1 has an overview of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter. Could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter?  Im including what I have already written so that you can see the style.  Many thanks and best regards.  Chris.    2 Overview of this Book  This book aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives.  In the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets, and which underlie the rest of the book.  As well as introducing the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and Monte Carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book.  In Chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices.  Apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices. We look at the well-know process of GBM as well as mean reversion, stochastic volatility and jump processes, discussing each, and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated.  Chapter 3, written by Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson of Enron Capital and Trade .  Chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets.  Although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves.  What we do in this chapter  Chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not-so-common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses.  Examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as energy swaptions, compound options, Asian (or average rate) options, Barriers, lookbacks, and ladder options.  Chapter 6 investigates single and multi-factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives.  Closed form solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps.  Chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and American style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6.  Simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options.  In order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial tree scheme is developed.  This tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard American style options.  Chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve.  The approach results in a multi-factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form.  Closed-form solutions are developed for pricing standard European options and efficient Monte Carlo schemes for exotic options.  The chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of American style options.  Chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions. In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time.  We begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7.  The general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi-factor hedging and this is also discussed.  Chapter 10 looks at the key risk-management concept of Value at Risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios.  After discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs (volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.  We then compare the fours major methodologies for computing VaR; Delta, Delta-gamma, historical simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation.  Finally, we look at testing the VaR estimates for various underlying energy market variables.  Finally, we finish with credit risk in energy markets in chapter 11.

__label__Save	Spanish Power Option Pricing Hi Paul/Cassim,  Further to our meeting yesterday regarding power options, that we may use to  capture short-term volatility from regulatory caps being adhered to or  broken, I have attached a spreadsheet that should assist in nailing down the  value.  ARBITRARY DISTRIBUTION The first issue to address is converting the price scenarios for the average  of the Q2-Q3 swap into a volatility equivalent.  This is achieved by fitting  a normal distribution that matches the one specified for mean and standard  deviation.  The graph below illustrates the method for the numbers discussed  yesterday.  In this example, the annualised volatility is coming up as  approximately 23%.    PRICING & IMPLIED VOLATILITY The pricing is as for a regular Asian option.  The payoff depends on the  average of the daily prices for Spanish power for Q2 and Q3.  The valuation  using 23% volatility is showing about 15.3 Pta per kWh.  I will schedule a meeting to allow us to take this forward.

__label__Save	possible RTP conference Dear Mr. Kaminski:  Thank you for talking with me about a possible RTP conference.  I would like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries.  As I indicated, Frank Wolak suggested that I contact you.  In discussing power markets with Frank and other colleagues at Stanford and EPRI, it seems quite evident that real-time pricing for retail customers is the forgotten resource in more efficient power markets.  There seems to be a lot of confusion about what RTP means and it also seems that many researchers need to address some practical but important problems.  I was asked whether a group like Stanfords EMF might explore this topic and give it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by policymakers.  Frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a useful approach and who might also see whether Enron could become a major sponsor.  I was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to Enron that the company might consider providing $25,000.  As you may appreciate, it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the conference is widely circulated among key government groups.  I would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and recommendations for people (perhaps yourself or a colleague) to participate.  I would also appreciate any consideration by Enron of providing funding for this effort.

Krishnarao Vice President, Enron Corporation  Dear Dr. Krishnarao,  Professor Veinott told me a little about the research going on at Enron from his conversation with you late last week. The work sounded very interesting to me. Professor Veinott also told me that the research group at Enron may have some positions for which I might be qualified. I am writing to let you know that I would have great interest in exploring this potential opportunity with you. To that end I attach my resume together with an abstract of my Ph.D. thesis under Professor Veinott as a Word document. I might also add that I expect to finish my Ph.D. in Management Science and Engineering here by July 1, 2001.  Incidentally, my work has led me to study your own thesis in some detail and I have been very impressed with it. It may be of some interest to you that our work is related and seems to require a different generalization of Karushs additivity-preservation theorem than the lovely ones you develop.

__label__Save	Help on cluster analysis Just wanted to pass a quick note to say thanks for all of your help that the  three of you each gave me concerning cluster analysis.  Your help was  invaluable .  As you may have been aware, we were performing the cluster  analysis to define the commercial zones in ERCOT.  I only had a few days in  which to learn the FASTCLUS procedure in SAS and prepare graphical views of  the results.    Your assistance ensured that Enron was seen as one of three market leaders  who had the capability to perform the analysis and cross check other market  participants analysis.  We were the only participant who had the ability to  graphically  display the results.    I was able to take the lead in a commercial meeting because of the data and  results.  I just wanted you guys to know that I really appreciated your help.  I have attached a couple of files that show some of the results.  The  presentation has the best overview.

To achieve   this goal, the BFS organizes every two years an International Congress.      The scientific program of the 2002 BFS Congress consists of plenary   talks and contributed papers. The invited plenary talks will give an   overview of the latest important developments in the field. They will   also present new ideas, directions and methodologies from Finance,   Economics, Econometrics and Mathematics and, discuss pressing problems   in the Finance and Insurance industries. The contributed papers will   complement the plenary talks with recent results and advances.       The overall scope is to create a unique interdisciplinary forum for   discussion of new concepts, incite stronger interaction across the   fields, and, at the same time, define new directions for the future   development of Mathematical Finance.

__label__Save	MarketPoint Business Plan Summary Vince:  Thanks very much for your interest in our MarketPoint product, and thanks for the hour you gave me this morning.  As promised, I am enclosing our executive summary and first chapter from our business plan for you to take forward to your management as a prospective Enron-MarketPoint investment collaboration.  I want to reiterate that should Enron elect to be the lead investor here, you will be exclusive in your industry if you want.  If Enron wants to be the lead and ensure the entire second round of resources we need, we would not offer and investment opportunity to other trading companies, pipelines, or electrics until the third or subsequent rounds and then only with your participation as a MarketPoint board member.  I am aware you have coinvested with SAP in the past and that you might want to coinvest with them again.  I presume you would not have a problem with non-competitors such as EPRI, our management consulting service provider partner, or our VC partner (but I would want guidance from you in this arena).  I think you would find our VC partner very suitable and very attractive.  They have done several interesting energy and trading plays, and they would provide good management skills I believe.  I hope we can move forward together.  I am looking forward to a positive response.  Thanks again and best regards.  Dale Nesbitt  PS:  You might hear from Drew Ries of your Investments group.  I spoke with him after speaking with you about many of the same issues.   - longexecsum.DOC Dale Nesbitt <dale.nesbitt@altosmgmt.com> dale.nesbitt@altosmgmt.com altosmgmt.com <vkamins@enron.com> vkamins@enron.com

They already figured that we must be interested in  modelling Dabhol. 2.  The WTI EOL trading simulation had an error.   We were counting a  mid-offer spread profit on each trade, but we actually would make the spread  on each round-trip transaction (one trade to open, one trade to close).    I  modified the calculation and sent the new numbers to Greg Whalley (he is the  one who caught the mistake, so there goes my bonus for the year.) and John  Lavorato.

Richard suggested that we have a strong dotted line of reporting in to him,  and that he will be available to support these areas.  Well meet regularly  to keep Richard in the loop.

Tuesday, December 12th will be reserved for rescheduling of  interviews.     The interviews will be scheduled for 30 minutes and will be conducted by two  members of the Project Sunrise technical team.   Before conducting the  interviews, the technical team will review the documented interviews to  determine any required missing information.    When possible, we will try to  replace the followup interview with a followup email and/or phone call to  limit your time commitment.    Typical follow-up questions will be:    What are your sources of data/information?   Where is the data/information currently stored?   Is the data/information automatically fed into SAP from another system? Please provide samples of reports/queries (including detailed calculations)  that demonstrate the information you desire.     Please be prepared to answer the above mentioned questions and/or refer us to  the appropriate parties so that we can all make the best use of our time.   Please let me know your availability.

Unfortunately,as soon as I got to India I was diagnosed wih a slip disc and  had to be in bed for a long time.  In the mean time the team continued to work on the concept of a sale to  another state out of the Dabhol plant.  I have developed the concept whereby  we are now looking at a firm component (over peak period), and an infirm  power sale during the monsoon.  The series of quesions and comments from my team in te attachment below  should help you a bit to get a feel for the proposal.  I am currently in  Houston and reachable at 281-345-9870.  I maybe needing a surgery for the  slip disc but am currently on medication hoping that surgery wont be needed.  I would like to wis you all a very happy XMas and a Great New Year, and will  catch you in the NEw YEar in Houston to discuss this wit you further.  I can  see that soem structuring help will be needed on this, and would like to get  some help from your end.

Vivek & I have also worked out a methodology for computing tariff for this  firm power sale during the peak period. In doing this, we have tried to keep  the tariff formula as simple as possible, while simulating the PPA tariffs to  the extent possible. (Currently, we have just shown the tariff computation;  will put the tariff formula in the next mail)  The tariff structure & the issue list obviously need further refinement,  before we discuss it with MSEB.

__label__Save	Re: stressing correlations Hi, everybody,  following up on our discussions on stressing correlations I made a  spreadsheet and a DLL.  Here is what it does:  in the input (Main sheet) the user has to specify: -the size of the correlation matrix; -the row and column for the element he wants to stress (row=1 and col=3 in  the example) -the integer number N_iter; -the original correlation matrix.  In the output (see sheet Results) we see 2 columns: -the first column contains possible correlation values (from -1 to 1,  N_iter+1 numbers) for the element (1,3),  -the second column contains the smallest eigenvalue for the stressed  correlation matrix  (which is the same as the original matrix except the elements (1,3) and (3,1)  which take values from -1 to 1).  Thus, the user can see which values for the chosen element (1,3) are  permitted  (those for which the smallest  eigenvalue is positive (marked green in the  example).  The user might decide that he wants to assign the correlation which is not  permitted to this particular element    (the smallest eigenvalue is negative). Then the user might have a few options: 1. all the elements of the correlation matrix will be modified so that the  chosen element has the desired correlation in it, but the change in the correlation matrix is the  smallest possible (in the sense of matrix norm) (this is my next step to do for this  spreadsheet). 2. Just one column (and the corresponding row, of course) will change, while  the rest of the matrix will stay unchanged (Kevins suggestion). In this case the user have to  choose which column (and row) he prefers to modify (in my example - column-row 1 or column-row 3).  We can discuss this approach with Risk Control and see how they like it. I  send you only the spreadsheet with an example now.  Tanya.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research  Group, is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of  talent we have currently in London. Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  its time to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.   My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader,  highly respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy  level and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.  His promotion is likely to cause Anjams departure form Enron. I value  technical skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, dont think he is the  same caliber as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to  Houston for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a  sufficient incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has  greatly improved.  Please, let me know what you think.

You mentioned that you could send me an interesting book on derivatives.  I am really looking forward to dive into it.  If you have two copies we may have one for reference and one for in-depth study at home.   You also mentioned that Tom Halliburton or Pereira could give a hands-on course in SDDP.  As I said, I am very interested in such a course some time this year.   Thanks and regards,   Andr?

__label__Save	California Update - Urgent Please Read 5/7/01 Sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today  The bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the California  Assembly.  The Republicans are currently in caucus until 3:30 PST and then  will go to the floor for a vote.  The current situation is very fluid, but  sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote,  lacking the two-thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance.  If this is the  case, the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be  forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans.  Absent of last minute  financial rescues by Davis or a new longer bridge loan package (unlikely)  Socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy.  The main problem would then be the  waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission  line purchase or other assistance.  There is an outside chance that Republican defectors could precipitate from  the current caucus.  There is extreme pressure on the Republicans from Davis  and Angelides.  If the bill failed due to lack of Republican support, it  would provide Davis the opportunity to blame Republicans for on-going  expenditures of $70M/day (power purchases), and a possible bankruptcy by  Socal.  The last Republican who gave support to a democratic bill (AB 1X),  Representative Bill Campbell, lost his job.  Sources also confirm that  Democrats have not met with Republicans on the bond issuance since last week.

__label__DontSave	RE: Scotts concerns about the Public Firm Models Hi Iris,  I also have copies of and have read the documents you mention; while they contain some good information, especially the movement model plan, the meeting summary is just that...a very general summary of a meeting with recommendations like hire quants and make sure there is adequate communication among the different teams.  The meeting summary addresses testing only briefly in saying be aware of the time dimension which is obvious and has been addressed by adding more equity driven ratios as well as our plan to add a time dimension to capture ratings momentum following a downgrade.      Perhaps you didnt understand my specific request for any ideas you might have to assist in model testing and also for an update on the Duffie report.  We still have not seen any drafts of what you learned.  As Im sure you recall, the teleconference with Vince, Vasant, and Amitava focused exclusively on private firm models, the scope of the project, and data acquisition considerations.  After the call, you suggested to Bryan, Eric, Mike and I that your report would include many of the issues in Georges 2 documents (movement model and meeting summary).  My personal hope, echoed by Bryan at that time, was that your report might be more insightful since the movement model, as you surely learned in your visit, is in its infancy and only one portion of the modelling effort and the meeting summary covered the most basic issues with minimal detail.      I sincerely want to establish a solid relationship with Houston Research and hope we can move forward together in a coordinated, team-oriented approach.  I look forward to discussing it with you at our Tuesday teleconference.  Best regards, Scott  FYI - George joined the company in Sep 2000 so could not have written the Movement Model proposal in April 2000.

During this conference call Vince, Vasant, Amitava and I pointed out some of the issues with the public firm models and the data used to develop these models.     In addition, after that conference call you, Bryan, Mike, Eric and I had further discussions as to how to sort out the public firm models.  During this discussion we all agreed that most of these issues had already been raised and addressed by George Albanis in the following documents:   1.  EnronCredit.com Project Proposal - Movement Model and Parallel Work - Phases IV,  by George Albanis, December 2000   2.  Meeting 25/01/2001 - Review, by George Albanis.     I also forwarded copies of these documents to you and Ben via email on May 11th.  Just in case you cant find them, I will forward them again.   Based on recent discussions with Jeff Kinneman, it is my understanding that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to figure out how to repair the public firm models.  Hence it may be more appropriate to direct any future concerns about the public firm models to their attention.

If you havent sent the report to him yet, perhaps we can request his opinions on best practices for testing models with limited quality out of sample test sets.  Obviously, Id like to discuss this in detail with you as well, especially since you understand the characteristics of the models and data better now, but Ill do that via phone.  Im hoping there are some statistical techniques were currently ignoring that we can employ to maximize the testing we do and get a better handle on judging our accuracy.  If youve got some time Tuesday after our meeting where Mike catches us up on the D&B issues, Id love to get your views as the model testbed is now in place and were starting a model recalbration phase.  Im least comfortable about our plans for stress testing the models once weve recalibrated them.  Looking forward to talking to you Tuesday.

I trust you got my message via the voicemail that Ileft with Vince late Friday afternoon about my inability to travel - Im trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of weeks time when my ear has cleared up, and I look forward to meeting with you one day.  I wrote to Vince last week asking for a favour, but Im not sure ifhe is there in Houston. I know that you guys are probably very busy but I was wondering if you can write a few sentences for me. Im sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively (all of them!) to my request for some feedback on the book. Chapter 1 has an overview of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter. Could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter?  Im including what I have already written (although I think it has changed slightly from this version) so that you can see the style.  Many thanks and best regards.  Chris.    2 Overview of this Book  This book aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives.  In the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets, and which underlie the rest of the book.  As well as introducing the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and Monte Carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book.  In Chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices.  Apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices. We look at the well-know process of GBM as well as mean reversion, stochastic volatility and jump processes, discussing each, and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated.  Chapter 3, written by Vince Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of  Enron Corporation, discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity  markets. This chapter builds on the previous one.  It examines in detail the methods, merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process  assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2.  Examples  from crude, gas, and electricity markets are used to illustrate the  technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility.  Chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets.  Although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves.  What we do in this chapter  Chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not-so-common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses.  Examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as energy swaptions, compound options, Asian (or average rate) options, Barriers, lookbacks, and ladder options.  Chapter 6 investigates single and multi-factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives.  Closed form solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps.  Chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and American style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6.  Simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options.  In order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial tree scheme is developed.  This tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard American style options.  Chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve.  The approach results in a multi-factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form.  Closed-form solutions are developed for pricing standard European options and efficient Monte Carlo schemes for exotic options.  The chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of American style options.  Chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions. In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time.  We begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7.  The general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi-factor hedging and this is also discussed.  Chapter 10 looks at the key risk-management concept of Value at Risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios.  After discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs (volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.  We then compare the fours major methodologies for computing VaR; Delta, Delta-gamma, historical simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation.  Finally, we look at testing the VaR estimates for various underlying energy market variables.

Extremely strong gas demand in the  Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high  load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge  new rival for Western Canadian supply.   The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first  of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the  TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at  about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly, said Klaus Exner, director  of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. The big picture overview that  I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and  California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down  that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and  into the PG&E systems. That hasnt let up at all and we dont foresee that  letting up.   PG&E Gas Transmission Spokeswoman Sandra McDonough said PG&E GT-NW has been  running full at 2.6 Bcf/d for some time and is delivering 900 MMcf/d to  non-California load in the Pacific Northwest. Were turning back demand  right now. Every power plant in this region is running full tilt. Tuscarora  [Gas Transmission], the Nevada pipeline, is full. Our Northwest deliveries  are fixed. Were delivering as much as we can deliver right now.   TransCanadas other major export route out of the Western Canadian  Sedimentary Basin is the Foothills and Northern Border route into the  Midwest. It also continues to operate at high load factors. We didnt see a  huge drop-off in physical flows post Nov. 1. Weve seen the IT volumes come  up considerably, said Exner. The one thing that has changed is the  volatility of the flows. Customers are making frequent intraday nomination  changes and were seeing more up and down and day-to-day variations,  according to the weather and the markets, than we would have when we had a  higher firm contract level. The fluctuations are driven purely by the price  differential between AECO and the Dawn Hub in Ontario, which indicates  whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not.   Alliance Pipeline spokesman Jack Crawford said the system has been running  flat out at about 1.325 Bcf/d since the valves were opened for commercial  service Dec. 1. He also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase  flows on the system. It has been estimated that Alliance could increase gas  flows to 1.5 Bcf/d with existing compression. The additional capacity would  be divided up among existing shippers, Crawford said. We havent cranked up  the system above the contract capacity yet. We probably wont do that for a  couple weeks until we get things ironed out. Frankly though, Im not sure  Chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the Pacific  Northwest and California.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- Margaret Carson margaret.carson@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com

__label__Save	Re: Equity investment Fair Value in Turkey John,  It seems to me that using a risk-free rate is not appropriate. I shall  elaborate on my  position and send you a longer message this afternoon (my time).  Vince         Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe    From:  John Bottomley                           06/19/2000 05:55 AM    To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Dale Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Equity investment Fair Value in Turkey  Vince,  John Sherriff recommended that I contact you regarding an interesting (and  potentially contentious) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with  in London.  We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which  is currently seeking to IPO.  The issue we are discussing with RAC is which  discount rate (i.e., risk-free? and if so Turkish or US?) should we use to  value these options  First, some additional information.  Option characteristics: -- 116,000 options (representing 9% of the company) -- Term:  minimum of 3 years but possibly longer -- still being renegotiated -- Strike price:  20% below the upcoming IPO price (either priced in US$ or  Turkish Lire)  We currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $118.75  per option but 34,800 expire on July 15, 2000 with the remainder expiring on  December 15, 2000.  The companys investment bankers (ABN / AMRO Rothchilds)  are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at  $118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $300 million.  Due  to such a large valuation gap, they originally encouraged us to exercise  all of the options by the end of June (IPO target date in late Sept / early  Oct).  Our counter-proposal is to swap instrinsic value for time value by  repricing the options strike higher while extending their term.  We are currently negotiating with RAC the most appropriate discount rate to  use to value the options.  We are arguing that the US risk free is the most  appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the companys  historical senior debt cost (18%) is the more appropriate number to use  (although admit that this is not justifiable -- only a proxy)  A few key points: -- RAC is valuing the options via Crystal Ball simulations such that this to  be negotiated discount rate is used to calculate the PV of the future  options intrinsic value in 3 years  (i.e., for Black-Scholes, a higher discount rate yields a higher value but  the opposite is true using Crystal Ball simulation) -- The model simulates both an IPO / no IPO case and in the case of no IPO we  have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17% return -- The model assigns a 30% illiquidity discount -- In the simulated cases where the options are out-of-the-money, we  obviously do not exercise.  We understand that for Black-Scholes option valuation, one needs to be able  to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and  the risk free in order for the valuation to hold.  And here is where we reach  our difficulty:  since the company doesnt currently trade on a public market  and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities, RAC is arguing  that a US risk free is not appropriate to use.  Our argument is that the  non-IPO scenario, a 30% illiquidity discount and a US$ based option  volatility are already in the factored into the simulation.  As such, we feel  RACs approach is double counting.  If you managed to get through the above, your a patient man!  Ill give you a  call today or tomorrow after youve had a chance to digest the information.

__label__DontSave	Re: The first document for audit Vince:  I read the relibaility-based VAR method document with interest.  Here are some comments:  1. The document falls short of describing how to use the method in practice, but rather gives some general motivation. I am confident that I myself could not develop an algorithm based on this document, unless all of the derivative valuation functions are explicit (and rather nice) functions with explicit derivatives of the underlying variables, in which case the VAR problem is not so hard in any case, as Monte Carlo is very effective in this case. (My comment here is critical of exposition. I do not suggest that the proposed method is weak!)  2. The remark (p. 2) that my paper with Jun Pan addresses only normal returns is not correct. The main point of our paper was to allow for jumps, including fat tails and skewness. The comment that we rely on delta-gamma is a good criticism,and the main potential advantage of the reliability approach, if it works in practical cases.  3. There is a typo at page 2, at 9 lines from the bottom, where I presume g(T(u)), not g(T(x))  4. There is a missing `we on page 5, 9 lines from the bottom.  5. The remark on CPU time (page 7) does not mention what machine was used.  6. The example (page 8) does not really have much non-normality. Skewness=0, and kurtosis (4) (is this excess kurtosis?) are not much compared to most practical cases, in which kurtosis is an extra order of magnitude, with lots of skewness.   Overall, the paper piqued my curiosity a lot, and left me wanting more clarity, and a cookbook.   I hope `events at Enron have not made things difficult for you.  I will later bill you for one hour, if that is OK.

Ive used a template created by Dr. Leppard which is why it looks so scary.   If you need constraints in the time direction then I will have to think a  little bit more about it. I think constraints in this direction are very model depenendent e.g.  stochastic volatility and local volatility models will throw up different constraints.

__label__DontSave	Enterprise-wide Risk Management Vince, I was just thinking about the subject project that you were trying to get off the ground (even though no commercial support existed!) that I worked on initially.  I know you were trying to get this done before I arrived and then followed my effort with at least one other person. I think the reason we could not complete a comprehensive project was we did not have the mandate from the CEO office to do it so that relevant commercial and functional entities can provide the required information.  Perhaps the reason there were no major thrust from the management was that most people knew the answer was going to be less than desirable.  However, such information would have correctly priced the risk (to the shareholder not its agents--the management) so that we could have better managed the $20 Billion or so company specific (taking systemic market down turn, including telecom exposure, out) market value that perished.    Great intuition on your part in trying to get such a risk measurement tool implemented. I wonder if you were able to advance that project and I now wonder if Greg Whaley would be interested sponsoring it from his office.  I would love to be the commercial lead interfacing with you to get such a project done now since it may help us with relevant (risk worthy) disclosure.

Currently, the ALP faculty committee is reviewing  all proposals received.  We also want to remind those who are planning to submit proposals of our  December 1st deadline. Please keep us updated on the status of your project.  We are happy to answer any questions or provide assistance.   Our goal is to have a good mix of projects from a variety of companies, and  we are also pleased to accept multiple projects from one company. Thus far,  many of our proposals are marketing and/or strategy related. To increase the  diversity of projects, we are especially looking for ideas that give our  students the opportunity to utilize finance skills. Of course, an ideal  project is one that allows a student to use multiple skills.  Again, thank you for your continued interest in Rice University and the Jones  School ALP program.

__label__Save	Re: Vol rollup John,  We can approach this problem this way.  Basically you are asking how the total variance (66%)2*143 are distributed among 113 days and the last?30 days.   Assuming volatility for the first period is simga1 and that in the ?last 30 ?days is sigma2, then??(66%)2*143=sigma12*113+sigma22*30  Futhermore, we can use Nov-00 implied volatility as a proxy to sigma1, then  we can calculate sigma2 which is the volatility for Dec-00 contract in the last 30  days.  sigam2=sqrt((66%)2*143-sigma12*113)/30.

I=  am currently working on the project, which requires the use of EMSS, and experience some difficulties interpreting the output results. Steven Leppar= d from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and=  consequently the person to contact in case of problems.  I have been running simulations for the Dutch market and was asked to provi= de the traders with some front-end screen graphs in order to interpret the numerical results. One of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack=  and systems marginal cost, as we only run cost based scenarios. To sort ea= ch stations hourly generation I need its marginal cost. To my knowledge thoug= h, marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit (TransArea Marginal Units query, Marg_cost unit). Therefore I was sorting the stations=  according to the cost which I calculated based on the outputs from Station=  Detail by Hour query. The calculation was as follows:  For each hour, for each generating station:  marginal cost [o/MWh] =3D (Generation_Cost [o000] * 1000)/Generation [MWh= ] - VOM_cost [o/MWh]  This I thought would include fuel cost and start up costs. However, a marginal station which I get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a station given in Marginal Station field in TransArea=  Marginal Units query.

__label__Save	Re: Support for Exotica Steve,  I am calling Anjam to give him a deadline regarding move to Houston. If he decides to stay in Houston, you should meet with him to convey the concerns regarding his performance.   Vince       Steven Leppard 10/13/2000 03:50 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dale  Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT, Tani Nath/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Paulo Issler/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sharad Agnihotri/LON/ECT@ECT, Zimin  Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Support for Exotica  All  Sharads investigations of Exoticas status in London have turned up a very  confused state of affairs. This isnt being helped by the fact that: 1. Anjam is rarely at his desk, and cant be found anywhere in the building. 2. When he is around he isnt willing or able to provide all the information  Sharad might need to support Exotica.   This is worrying since much of our business depends on the validity of  Exoticas valuations.  Sharad will now request information from Anjam via email to leave a trail,  and I want to alert you to the fact that Sharad will be ccing you in on  these emails.    If things dont improve soon, I may need to request some assistance in  extracting this information from Anjam.

__label__DontSave	Alliance Info Alert: FERC Meeting/Filings Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:  At its brief meeting yesterday, FERC approved a stripped-down consent agenda,  without discussion, as described below.  Following this summary is an updated  listing of filings at FERC.  In particular, FERC:  (1) Approved, 3-1, with Comm. Hebert dissenting, an extension of the existing  temporary $1,000/MWh bid caps in the ISO-NE energy, automatic generation  control and operating reserve markets through March 31, 2001.  (2) Rejected an aspect of ISO-NEs July 28 CMS/MSS compliance filing, namely  its proposed Installed Capacity (ICAP) deficiency charge, and directed the  ISO to reinstitute the previous, administratively-determined deficiency  charge that the Commission required the ISO to revert to in its June 28  Order; other aspects of the filing will be addressed separately, FERC  indicated.  (3) Accepted in part, and rejected in part, American Transmission Company,  LLC.s (ATC) proposed OATT and rates, with Comm. Massey concurring.  Among  other things, FERC rejected ATCs innovative rate proposal, without prejudice  to ATC submitting a new FPA Section 205 rate filing, based on its finding  that ATCs ROE and other rate proposals amounted to a request for the  innovative rates that we have indicated we would consider in an RTO  context.  ATC sought such rates prior to joining an approved RTO, FERC  specified, distinguishing this case from its September 28 Order authorizing  innovative rate treatment for International Transmission Company.  (4) Accepted for filing TransEnergies two filed compliance reports on its  procedures for reassignment of transmission rights and the results of its  open season, respectively.  (5) Rejected proposed amendments filed by two Southern Energy parties to  their respective Reliability Must Run (RMR) Agreements with CA ISO, after  finding the amendments were inconsistent with the terms of a prior RMR  settlement.  Numerous significant items were stricken, including the Alliance RTO  compliance filing (CAE-27), the Southern petition concerning its RTO plans  (CAE-23), and the Illinois Power-MISO withdrawal docket (CAE-16).                                  == RECENT FERC FILINGS ==  (1)  RTO DEVELOPMENTS  *  TENASKA filed a motion to intervene out of time regarding ALLIANCEs pro  forma generator interconnection procedures and agreement contained in the  proposed ALLIANCE RTO OATT.

__label__DontSave	RATS License Update Vasant,  I had a chance to speak today with a representative from Estima, the maker of RATS.  Evidently, our current license is as follows:    Version:  RATS 4.0 (original license cost of $ 1,200.00)   Max. No. of Users: 4  The following options outline the costs of upgrading the software:  Option 1  Version:  RATS 5.0 Users: Site license for Houston/unlimited   RATS 5.0 $ 5,100.00  CATS module $ 1,200.00     (cointegration module)  X-11 module $ 1,200.00     (RATS implementation of Census Bureaus seasonal adjustment--aids in    $ 7,500.00        adjusting quarterly and monthly data as well as options for identifying      trading days and holidays in time series)   Option 2  Version:  RATS 5.0 Users: 100   RATS 5.0 $ 4,500.00  CATS module $ 1,200.00  X-11 module $ 1,200.00    $ 6,900.00  Option 3  Version: RATS 5.0 Users: 50   RATS 5.0 $ 3,600.00  CATS module $ 1,200.00  X-11 module $ 1,200.00    $ 6,000.00  Option 4  Version RATS 5.0 Users: 25   RATS 5.0 $ 2,500.00  CATS module $ 1,100.00  X-11 module $ 1,100.00    $ 4,700.00  Note that we currently have a number of users of RATS both within Research and throughout EGM (Equities, Freight, Fundamentals, Crude Products).  I would recommend, at a minimum, that we upgrade our license to 50 users with base RATS 5.0.  Cointegration can obviously be performed without the automated CATS module--I am not too certain of the utility of the X-11 module.

__label__DontSave	RE: OStrip Function I know, Zimin. It was/is an honest mistake, and I am hurting from it. It does seem that things have worked out, and that the issue has been resolved with Larry May and John Griffith. Additionally, I have been in touch with Jeremy Wong to ask that the ERMS coding be updated, and have been in communication with Eric Moon (Gas Structuring) to make sure that the structurers are aware of the changes made. Eric told me that they have always used the OSTRIP function for fixed price options in the manner which is correct by the documentation.   Paulo suggested that I find out if there are any power traders who use the function and alert them. I asked Alex but he didnt know of anyone. I also talked to Iris, but she didnt know of anyone either, although she did say that they have priced strips on the power desk before. Would you know of anyone who uses this function on the power desks, so that I might contact them? Thanks.   Tom   PS I trust the conference (and Paris) are treating you well.  -----Original Message----- From: Lu, Zimin  Sent: Thursday, November 08, 2001 3:44 PM To: Barkley, Tom Cc: Issler, Paulo; Kaminski, Vince J Subject: FW: OStrip Function   Tom,   I asked you to call Larry before I left Houston.  I believe that this is an honest mistake, but I do not want  it ever happen again.      Zimin  -----Original Message-----  From: Griffith, John  Sent: Thu 11/8/2001 2:10 PM  To: May, Larry  Cc: Arnold, John; Issler, Paulo; Barkley, Tom; Lu, Zimin; Maggi, Mike; Moon, Eric; Kaminski, Vince J  Subject: OStrip Function    As you know, the Ostrip Functionality has been altered.  This change has affected the way the larryoptmodel values the gas daily options.  The reason the larryoptmodel is affected is because the larryoptmodel was defining the inputs to the Ostrip model differently than the documentation asked.  Let me explain.  The Ostrip Model has the following date inputs:  NowToSet        - Fixed Price = zero                  - Forward Start = days from now until strike is set   BegDays - Fixed Price = days from now until start of option                  - Forward Start = days from when strike is set until start of option   EndDays - Fixed Price = days from now until end of option                  - Forward Start = days from when strike is set until end of option   FwdStFlag       - Fixed Price = 0                  - Forward Start = 1   The Ostrip model should overlook the NowToSet days if the FwdStFlag = 0 (fixed price option).  It assumes the option is set right now.  The Old Ostrip Model did not overlook this input.  This is the problem.  In Larryoptmodel, the NowToSet is the same for Fixed Price options and Forward Start Options, the BegDays is the same and the EndDays is the same.  Thus when the Old Ostrip Model incorrectly used the NowToSet days, this made the Larryoptmodel value the option correctly.  When the New Ostrip Model was put into production, this model overlooks the NowToSet date, thus giving an incorrect value in Larryoptmodel.  Larryoptmodel has to be changed to reflect the above inputs.  It is actually only a change to one date.  This date will be used in calculating the three days above.  If the option is a fixed price option then the date will be today and NowToSet will be Today minus Today (zero), BegDays will be Start of Option minus today, EndDays will be End of Option minus today.  If the option is a forward start option, then the date will be when the strike is set and the NowToSet with be the strike setting date minus today, BegDays will be Start of Option minus the strike date, EndDays will be the End of Option minus strike date.  It is important to note that it is unexcusable to make any changes to the models without consulting the traders first.  If there was a problem with the Old Ostrip Model then the trader should have been notified right away.  This could have meant that the options were being misvalued when trading.  In this case, however, Larry had figured a way around this problem and he was valuing correctly.  When the model was changed, that changed the larryoptmodel valuation and now it was being valued incorrectly.  Either way, any problems with the models should be communicated with the traders right away.  Any changes to the models should be communicated to the traders before they are made.  Please let me know if any have any questions or concerns.  Thanks.

__label__Save	Treasury Memo Kevin,   the memo looks good.  One suggestion I have is to emphasize what we can  deliver by end of January since that was the initial deadline.  Although the  memo indicates that a lot of work has been done, the reader might want to  know what he can get in his hand in terms of models or quantitative results.   You will of course describe everything in your presentation, but given that  setting up presentations may take time, you should think about creating some  template/model and send it with brief explanations.  For example, a template  for TRS as it stands, and a template listing trigger events and how the  results will be displayed.  You can then expand on this in your presentations.

__label__DontSave	Meet the Head of the Leading Firm in Our Business Meet the head of the leading firm in our business.  Imagine the opportunity!  Imagine that the leading energy company in the world has picked you to run  the  company that it expects to be the leading retail energy company in North  America.  So you get a sharp competitive edge in the back room, you recruit IBM as a  co-owner assuring you the lowest cost per customer by a factor of two or  three.  To get your foot in 27 million doors you recruit AOL as a co-venturer with a  commitment from AOL to promote NewPowers wares.  You do an IPO and take in  about $700 million for working capital.  The IPO is over and the quiet period  it required.  But the most important silver spoon -- so that you get your  energy at the best price and to protect you against price spikes -- you get  up front 30 Enron-trained   risk managers and traders.  Can you imagine  having to recruit them?  To make sure this team is run by the optimum chief they picked Eugene  Lockhart,  most recently president of Consumer Services at AT&T and before  that president of BankAmericas Global Retail Bank with its consumer,  commercial and small business banking services delivered through 3,000+  branches.  Now, Lockharts talking about his plans.  Restructuring Today had lunch with Lockhart Thursday and reported in detail  (to read the full story see attachment):  ? How NewPower intends to actually start up the retail industry?  What is the  heart of NewPowers business plan? ? How theyll make money in markets where margins may seem too thin. ? How hes going to have 600,000+ customers next month and easily a million  by the end of 2001. ? What percentage of their sales come from the NewPower website.  What figure  is he using for cost of customer acquisition? ? Lockhart plans to have by the end of the first quarter or at the latest the  second quarter 750,000 customers making them by far the largest unregulated  retail  marketer in the US. ? How does he think utilities will compete with the NewPower paradigm? ? What marketshare do they expect to get at first and then by 2005? ? What does he see as his biggest challenge? ? Why is this a good time for NewPower to invade California markets? ? Why will NewPower succeed where Enron failed? ? Whats the role of backward dating in forward market margins? ? Where NewPower gives a 20-25% discount on the commodity portion of a bill,  what kind of margin can it make now? ? How do higher prices help NewPower?  Were actually in a very good  position given (that) the gas cost increases perversely will work in our  favor ...  ? We have a 10-year, exclusive agreement with IBM whereby we can issue a  bill, collect the money and care for a customer at lower cost than anyone  else in the industry by several orders of magnitude.

__label__Save	Meeting for Friday on Storage Hi Mark, I have not met you yet but heard a lot of good things about you.  = I would like to discuss with you and possibly with John Bloomer and Richard=  Reichardt about the EBS Researchs role in supporting the Storage market development from the origination and trading perspective.  There are severa= l people in various groups that are talking about storage but here is whats = my take on our involvement--please correct me or suggest otherwise.   Shalesh Ganjoo is our lead analyst on this effort.  In addition to his effo= rt with your group, he is presently supporting Jean Mrha with pricing and standardization for a traded storage maret--Stinson Gibner is directly supervising him in this effort.  Shalesh came to us through referal from David Cox--David discovered him at=  one of his speaking engagements.  Shalesh had talked to David about traded=  storage market development some time last October and David refered Shalesh=  to Enron Research group. We hired Shalesh for general analyst position and=  now he is pulled into all aspect of this storage effort.  Currently, he is=  our point person (with Stinson or I supervising his effort) who is supporti= ng Jean Mrha and you on the subject.  Kara Knop has aproached Shalesh with request for some support and Shalesh and she are sorting out each other=01,= s role in this regard.  As per my discussion today with David, we need to coordinate this storage effort from the perspective of modeling market assessment etc. For this I suggest Shalesh and his effort so that all parti= es involved can benefit from collective effort within one central source.  Bas= ed on Davids and my assessment of Shaleshs capabilities, I would like to suggest that the commercial heads use Shalesh for his creative thinking, understanding of the market and analytical capabilities and not just for da= ta gathering and simple research effort. We can add other staff as we see the=  need and as you request them.  Please respond this e-mail with your comments if this sounds like aplan, so=  that we can support this effort efficiently and in a scalable manner.  Kind Regards,  Ravi.   A bit about EBS Research Group  John Bloomer and Richard Reichardt have met me and are aware of my role and=  Stinston Gibners role in EBS. I lead a team of quantitative professionals=  via a group we are calling EBS Research.  This group reports to Stinson Gibner (VP) and Vince Kaminski (MD and Head of Enron Research).  Stinson an= d Vince are the original founders of Enron Corp Research that has been charge= d with model development efforts to support Enron Energy trading and other Enron business.  Enron Research is involved in all aspects of Enron buiness= es (EES, International, Corporate affairs such as FAS 133 and other accounting=  and new product (derivatives) development, etc.).  Within EBS Research, there serveral professionals supporting Kevin Howard=  (CFO office), John Griebling, Tom Gros and Jean Mrha, David Cox (via Boris)= , and the War room.

Unfortunately, supply and demand is not a good indicator of predicting prices because of the economic complexity of processing aromatics.  Statistically, there is no relationship between utilization, supply, demand and price.  Inserting time lag does not make the number any better either.   Christian         -----Original Message----- From:  Neale, Nelson   Sent: Thursday, April 12, 2001 5:23 PM To: LeBroc, Christian Subject: Re: Petrochemical Forward Curves  Hi Christian,  Both mean reversion and GBM models assume that all information related to a future price may be found in the historical price.  The approach employed in the ag curves suggests that there may be some fundamental information related to supply and demand that impacts also drives future price.  A portion of the mean reversion process is actually captured with inclusion of lagged prices  (autoregressive component).  A GBM process requires some information on price volatility.  Since there is presumably no forward/future curve for the commodity of interest, it is difficult to come up with historical volatility values.  Hope it helps.

__label__DontSave	Risk Profile and Liability Mitigation Product Please find attached a Scope of Services document and a list of projects  which have been implemented with current EES customers.  The Scope of  Services document is designed to show the types of projects, operations and  maintenance, and facilities management services that EESO typically offers to  its customers based on their industry segment.  The projects and services  offered are very similar across segments and customers, but their level of  deployment varies significantly from segment to segment.    Certain segments were grouped together because the EESO offering would  feature similar assets and services. SIC Codes were given for each segment to represent the types of customers  that comprise each segment.  The list of projects represents general categories from which more specific  projects will be tailored to fit the clients needs.  This project list  represents assets that have been approved by the DSM Desk and was queried  from PCCS. The Operations and Maintenance services can be applied to any energy-related  assets and was compiled from term sheets and IAM.  Generally those activities  have been limited to a few industrial outsourcing deals including Springs,  Polaroid and recently Eli Lilly. Facilities Management is usually outsourced via IPT or through the adoption  of existing vendor contracts and can involve repair and maintenance for all  assets.   Generally this type of activity has been focused on the retail/real  estate segment.      Cheryl, pls set up a meeting with Harris, Clayton, Bouillion, Jones and  Kaminski to discuss this and an action plan to develop a liability mitigation  product.  I will re-present the original product concept at the meeting.   Would like to see the meeting take place late next week.  Thanks.

As it turns out, Christian left RAC in  April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at  construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or  SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of  the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked  about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that theyd only been  around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John  Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.     From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at  least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to  understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday  during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX  component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could  then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors  (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

__label__DontSave	FW: Vince, I want you to be aware of the discussions between RAC, IT and Research regarding using more than 7 factors for VAR.  I presented this idea couple of months ago. This will resolve the issue of capturing term-structure of correlations across different commodities which we have for our current VAR system and which we try to overcome by some patches (joint factors for selected groups of commodities). This will not increase the amount of calculations. In fact, just the opposite, this will decrease the number of independent random variables which drive the model from approximately 1000 to about 60-40.  RAC did not pay much attention at that time. IT was busy with other things. This task was low priority.  Recently Naveen realized that his Convolution VAR will not work unless this idea of increasing the number of factors  is implemented. With the present system he needs to deal with 1000 independent random variables and this is not feasible for Convolution (or Analytical) VAR.   We had a meeting regarding this issue last week and the consensus was finally to go ahead and increase the number of factors. This is good news because we need this change in our system for the new Reliability VAR as well.  What worries me that Naveen presents this change now as part of the Convolution VAR. Not only it sounds now like his idea, but, more importantly, I am afraid that when we need the same change (60 factors) for Reliability VAR we will have to seek IT support again and compete with RAC for resources and we always loose in this battle. In addition, the  Monte-Carlo is not going away so the right thing to do is to implement 60 factors in our production system.

To implement the method for current VaR (Monte Carlo method) needs many changes to existing programs, hence it will take longer.  The methodology is simple, but there are still some issues need to be confirmed/resolved, mostly related to data.  1. Data Alignment:  I understand that we will use fixed contract methodology from now on. We still need expiration rules to find prompt month for each primary curves.  Hence we still need make sure all expiration rules are set up correctly for each primary curve.  2. Data missing:  How do we handle data missing problem.  What should we do if there are some missing prices for some curves.  Do we recreate those missing data or do we eliminate all the prices on those missing dates?  If we recreate, then how.  If we eliminate, then we may eliminating many good data because a few bad curves.  3. What will be the implication if we mix weekly curves with monthly curves together.  It seems OK, but we need make sure this is the case.  4. Do we still need factor look up for those inactive curves?  Or we dont care since we are using their true history.  There may be some other issues coming up when get into the design.

__label__DontSave	Improved Process for Engaging Temporary Workers As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy staffing requirements throughout the company.  For the past several months,=  a project team, representing Enron=01,s temporary staffing users, have resear= ched and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour= ce would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan= ce and cost containment objectives.  The Business Unit Implementation Project=  Team members are:  Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate George Weber, GSS  In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA),=  Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the=  Selection Project Team.  As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn= ing of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g= roup will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing=  vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. =  The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the bes= t interests of the organization.  We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=   This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=  temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhanceme= nt will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all=  current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in service during this transition.  We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha, Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T= he scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw= o phases have been completed.  Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=  selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=  management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o= ur staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective=  and simple means for obtaining temporary employees.  In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group will b= e communicating to Enron=01,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vend= ors about the new process.   There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are outlined on the attached page.  More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF=01= ,s Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed Services team.

A projected weekend outage at the 1,087 MW Diablo Canyon Unit 2 nuclear power plant and a 10-day outage at the 820 MW IPP Unit 1 coal power plant should keep supplies scarce heading into next week. At COB, power for today rose over $15 to $270. Power sold at Mid-Columbia for today was up $15 at $267. Concern is mounting about the possibility of a dry year in the Pacific Northwest, which could keep prices high into the spring. In the Southwest, power prices declined amid lower day-ahead demand. According to the California PX, demand  will peak at 32,435 MW today. Palo Verde slipped $36 to $137 per MWh, while Mead traded down $32 at $146 per MWh.  Alliance Begins Commercial Operations      Alliance pipeline is finally ready to begin commercial shipment of Canadian natural gas to Chicago from northern British Columbia today and operators are already talking about expanding the system. Originally scheduled to begin flowing in October, the delayed opening is set for the pipeline to begin transporting today. The addition of the $3 billion Alliance pipelines capacity curbed price increases at Chicago yesterday relative to spikes in the Northeast. Cold weather headed for the East Coast triggered a 9% price jump in the regions prices yesterday. Prices at the New York City gate surged $0.75 per MMBtu to a record high of $7.20, while Chicago prices were only Up $0.35 at $6.41 per MMBtu. Canada supplies about 16% of US natural gas. Alliance is one of two new pipelines beginning operations this week. BC Gas C$375 million Southern Crossing Pipeline from eastern British Columbia to the West Coast began pumping 250 MMcf per day on Thursday in competition with Westcoast Energy. For its part, the Alliance system is seen by some as a key link in the eventual transport of Arctic natural gas to market. BP Amoco has assumed the transportation responsibilities of eight shippers on the pipeline whose volumes total more than 250 MMcf per day, and plans to increase that amount. Alliance partners include Westcoast Energy, 23.6%; Enbridge, 21.4%; Fort Chicago Energy Partners, 26%; Williams, 14.6%; and Coastal, 14.4%.  We will be adding Southern Crossing to the next base case.  Also, some corrections are needed in our Alliance model.  Further research shows that the maximum receipt capacity from B.C. to be about 300 / day (9,120 / month) and from A.B. to be 1,950 / day (59,280).  Alliance receives no supplies in the Northwest Territories and has no plans for doing so.  The only existing connection to NWT is into Westcoast.  I would change its capacity to 400 / day (12,160 / month), increasing to 500 / day (15,200) in 2002.  Nova (TCPL Alberta System) is considering an extension into NWT in the future.  The current base case shows a need for more than 500 / day starting in 2006.  So, Ive set up a supply link from NWT into Nova at 300 / day starting in 2006.   Pollution Credits Shutting Down California Power Plants      AES says output from three of its power plants in southern California has been cut in half due to a shortage of pollution credits. AES Pacific has curtailed 2,000 MW of a total capacity of 4,000 MW at its three natural-gas fired plants in the Los Angeles area, Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach. The move followed the filing of a petition by the South Coast Air Quality Management District related to its Alamitos plant which had exceeded its NOX emission allocation. Both Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach were close to reaching their NOX allocations. The plants could operate if the California ISO declared a power emergency.  An arbitration board is due to rule in late December on the air quality districts petition. California has been struggling to meet surging demand for power this year. There have also been few power plants built during the last decade and the California ISO has had to issue numerous power alerts this year as operating reserves dropped to critical levels. The California ISO says a number of other plants are also running out of pollution credits.  Coastal to Buy Pipe for Gulfstream       Coastal has agreed to buy steel pipe for the Gulfstream natural gas pipeline from Berg Steel Pipe Corp for $310 million. Coastals 774-mile pipeline will run from Mobile, AL across the Gulf of Mexico to Tampa. Duke and Williams, which had been developing a competing project, agreed earlier this month to buy Coastals pipeline. Terms were not disclosed. Coastals purchase was for the 36-inch diameter pipeline to run through the Gulf of Mexico and the 36-inch and 30- inch pipe for Florida. Pipe production will start immediately with delivery starting early next year in Port Manatee, Florida, and Mobile. All of the pipe is scheduled for delivery by September, and the pipeline is scheduled to start by June 2002. Coastal plans to complete the sale of the Gulfstream system this quarter.  According to Williams Buccaneer website, upon closure of the purchase of Gulfstream by Williams - Duke, Gulfstream will be built in lieu of Buccaneer.  Our next base case database will reflect this change.  Power Marketers Accused of Manipulating Prices      Enron, PG&E Energy Trading, Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, Sempra Energy Trading and Dynegy Power Marketing are among a dozen energy companies accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to manipulate California wholesale electricity prices.  The lawsuit claims companies selling electricity in California intentionally limited supply to drive up prices. The suit seeks certification as a class action covering all electricity consumers in California, estimates damages in excess of $1 billion. The allegations in the lawsuit are based on a number of studies of the states electricity market that concluded it was not functioning normally. Southern California Edison and PG&Es Pacific Gas & Electric filed suit against state officials separately last month for permission to charge customers billions of dollars for losses from open-market power purchases.

__label__DontSave	California on the Brink--CERA Alert CERA Alert: December 13, 2000   Title: California on the Brink  CERA Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas   CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK  The California Stalemate  California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over  credit-worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would  avoid selling to the California market. While numerous factors have  contributed to the high cost of power incurred by Californias utilities, the  root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current  credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address  the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be  focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible.  Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this  summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California  consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis,  regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and  significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied  the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end  their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance  the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable  accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market.   The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the  galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to  address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is  no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective  solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail  markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain  muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is  possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail  to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will  instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws.   In the six months since Californias supply shortfall began plaguing Western  markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem.  Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market  environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and  demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for  the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed,  several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by  discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated  changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a  challenging siting and permitting process.  Medicine Worse than the Illness  Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were  accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay  adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus  over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of  bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of  Californias electric market woes.*   * Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better  coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power  plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone  has struck down some key proposed facilities.  * Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices  limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially  for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment  to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state.   * Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including  the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new  plant development.  * Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the  FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the  California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of  gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits  are a threat to new plant development.  * Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials  to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of  their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust.  CERAs recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West  are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability  are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of  older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors.  Californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of  financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers  considering entering the state.   Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in  the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that  demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001.  In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a  sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the  earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of  capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk  of an outage.   The Road to Recovery  There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity  shortfall:   * Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a  series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal  some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these  actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not  enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.?   * Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will  ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the  credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new  build.  * Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the  pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence  (and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in  the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With  the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move  toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a  series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If  they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect  of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient  justification for recovering the cost of these commitments.  * Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although  originally a feature of Californias market design, most consumers are  insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing  customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a  demand response.  * Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the Boom Bust characteristic of  the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement,  or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to  move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the  market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to  elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate)  future price volatility.  * Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to  be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable  to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term  contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the  market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since  July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to  do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its  course.   * Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a  more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply  shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to  emissions restrictions.   * Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA  power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from  operating to generate only power.   **end**   This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within 24 hours.   **********************************************************************  This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information  from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

__label__Save	Re: short-sell vs exercise Chonawee,  As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad  decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).  Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option. You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to  $100.   You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise  gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxes on your option income (its treated as ordinary income). The tax is 28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss against ordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes.   Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option  position as an offset.  The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have  income in the future (or capital gains).  Not so good.  By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options is a very interesting and difficult problem.  Vince       Chonawee Supatgiat@ENRON 07/10/2000 11:40 AM To: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: short-sell vs exercise  Below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere. It  explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised  but cannot be sold. (As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call  option before its maturity). However, after taking Vinces comments on the  ordinary income/capital loss TAX offsetting issue, I think this is not a good  article anymore. I guess I could just throw this article away. :-) -chonawee   Short-selling is better than exercising your employee stock options  In general, the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when  you speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low. In  fact, when exercising the options, you are speculating that ENE would never  reach this point (plus interest) again during the 10 years maturity date or  until you leave the company. If you do not anticipate that, you should hold  on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your  exercise.  However, if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak. Then, instead of  exercising the options, you should short-sell (or sell) the stocks in that  amount. After short-selling, when you feel that the stock starts to go up,  you can buy them back (to cover), make profit, and still keep the options. On  the other hand, if the stock does not go down as expect, you can exercise the  options to cover your short position anytime.   Let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes, no dividends,  and zero risk-free rate. Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as  follow   If you exercise 100 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70,  you would earn  (70-45)*100 = $2,500. But if you short sell 100 ENE at 70, no  matter how much ENE is in the future, you can exercise the options to cover  the short position and still earn (70-45)*100 = $2,500. The advantage of  short-selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60. At this point, you can  cover your short position, get (70-60)*100 = $1,000, and still keep your  options or you can exercise the options and gain $2,500. That is, you still  keep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell. In conclusion, the  only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your  short position.

Best wishes for the New Year.    It would certainly be great to see you and to meet Eric some time in the ne= xt few months.     Everyone here was very impressed with Giuseppe and we are eager to have another of your=  students come to Enron.  Enron Broadband is continuing to evolve and the current vision is to rely o= n Enrons trading expertise while trying to minimize our role as an engineering company and innovator of technology.   = I spoke recently with Jim Fallon, the current head trader in EBS, and we put together a short list of topics of interest=  where you might be able to help educate us. I put these in the order of interest (to Mr. Fallon).  1.   Where will bandwidth prices go?   The direction of prices, obviously i= s the concern of any trader.   We realize that technological innovation will continue to drive down prices, but are still=  interested in trying to quantify how fast prices will fall,  if there are likely to be certain bottlenecks in the fiber network where yo= u could see prices stable or rising for some length of time,  if there are applications on the horizon which would use such prodigious amounts of bandwidth as to have some effect on pricing, and if there is a rational way of trying to quantify the timing and effect = on prices of new technologies.  The term bandwidth might primarily mean lit fiberoptic capacity, but cou= ld also incompass dark fiber, or IP transit and transport pricing.  2.  During the last year, Enron purchased a company known as Warpspeed in=  order to acquire their MetaRouter technology.   To quote from the Enron pre= ss release:  MetaRouter sends signals throughout distributed networks to determine the=  optimal connectivity paths for any size bandwidth capacity from anywhere in=  the world. Capable of processing thousands of connections per second, MetaRouter significantly enhances Enron=01,s ability to automate circuit provisioning.  There may be two separate questions to ask here.   First,  in the context o= f the current market (or the market which may develop in the next 1-2 years),=  will the MetaRouter be a commercially viable product?   That is,  will it=  address an actual need in the market, or would it be more cost effective ju= st to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits?  The second question (our first real technical question):  is the MetaRouter=  technology scalable?     Before starting on this project, Vince and I will=  need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are implementing this technology.  3.  Aggregation of loads.   A recurring question comes from a number of are= as such as IP, network storage, and   streaming media transport sales:  What=  value can I get form aggregating customers, each of which has some type of=  stochastic load profile?   Giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates t= o IP transport, but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail.   =  The main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual=  customer data.   I am told that in a few months we will have some more usef= ul history.   My understanding is that what will be available will be 5-minute=  averages of usage, so we still will not know on a short time scale what the=  distribution of load looks like.   I hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our=  concerns are at this point.   Please let me know your thoughts about these=  topics.   I would expect, for instance that question number 1 may not be reasonable as a research project, but might be a question which you would=  feel comfortable in addressing by giving us  your qualitative opinions, may= be in the form of a talk here at Enron.      Again,  let me know your thoughts, and I look forward to seeing you again=  soon.

I would hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into the problem/opportunity generation environment. That really helps the student to develop a realistic vision about their research.  Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quart= er, say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing.

__label__DontSave	the special pattern recognition problems Hi Vince  Heres a rough draft for your perusal and comments.  I can be reached at (517) 423 5617.   We at ICAST have had a meeting to explore the two problems we discussed with you and Vasant over the phone last week, and we have decided we feel confident we can find optimum solutions to these problems given the necessary support.  Outlined below is the approach we have used for solving difficult pattern recognition problems in the past for Eli Lilly and GM.  If Enron is interested in this approach, we would be happy to submit a proposal to Enron to take on this project for one or both of the problems you described.  Task 1.  Our company will analyze the data sets available from Enron for one week at our own expense.  The purpose of this analysis is to estimate the cost (amount of time and the skill set needed) to develop proof-of-concept prototype software.  Task 2.  ICAST will then demonstrate the POC software to the Enron scientists at the Enron facilities using the training set(s) and one or more new data sets.  Task 3.  Given successful demonstrations of the POC solution(s), ICAST and Enron will meet to discuss the efficacy of the approaches used and will determine jointly the specifications of planned production software, and the method of providing this capability to Enron for routine every day use.  Task 4.  ICAST will submit proposals for developing the production versions of the softare that will meet the agreed upon specifications.   The cost of developing the proof-of-concept software, and the labor needed to demonstrate it to Enron is estimated to be $150K (plus out-of-pocket expenses) for each of the problems, and, it is estimated at this time that the calendar time needed for each of the projects is about 4-months.  It may be possible to do the two Proof-of-concepts concurrently.  I will call you before the end of the week to discuss this recommended approach.

Zimin     -----Original Message----- From: Nordstrom, Mary  Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 10:52 AM To: Lu, Zimin; Lee, Bob Subject: FW: Izzy Nelken     Over the past year, Ive been doing a lot of work to one of the largest Chicago market making firms in equity options. The project has to do with the Market Microstructure.  With high degree of accuracy we can predict where the stock price is going to go in the next 15 seconds to 60 seconds. This technique can NOT be used to predict where the stock will be tomorrow or even in the next hour. As these are only short term predictions, the changes in the stock are usually small. Therefore, this technique is of no use to day traders. However, suppose you need to buy stocks anyway. For example, if you need to delta hedge an option position and buy some stock, the model might tell you to wait a few minutes and save a few pennies.  Every time the stock moves and the trader has to modify the position, they consult our model and decide on their action: buy now or wait. Of course, this also works for sell now or wait. Indeed, we found out that they save about 3-4 cents per stock trade. The market makers typically trade hundreds of millions of stocks a year so this is quite interesting to them.  We also have a project with one of the major US banks to apply this to foreign currency (forex) markets.  At this stage, it would be interesting to adapt this project to other markets. For example crude oil comes to mind. The project involves two stages: a) A feasibility study to check if this is possible to do. b) Building a real time system to give signals to the traders.  I think we can do step (a) independently without any commitment on your part.  We would then apply our models and see if we can come up with anything interesting. We have access to tick data through a commercial service called e-signal. I believe that it is reasonably good. If you have access to better tick data then it would be helpful for us to obtain several days (perhaps two weeks) of tick data (bids, asks and trades which are time stamped).

__label__DontSave	Data for Moodys RiskCalc Iris  From the initial work that I Ben and I have done, data availability for the Moodys model is relatively good for European companies. However, there are problems for certain jurisdictions (e.g., the Netherlands) where reporting requirements are low. Also, all newly established entities with no accounts cannot be priced.  You may be aware that S&P has a similar model. You can find the description at www.creditmodel.com. We met with S&P earlier this morning and they will give us logins that I will forward to you. I have not looked at the details, but it appears to me that the Moodys model could be more relevant for our purposes as the S&P model is calibrated of companies that S&P has rated, whereas Moodys has actually got data not only retsricted to the firms they rate. Moreover, the S&P threshold USD 100m) is very high.  For US counterparties, there may be a problem as private US firms do not need to publish accounts. In any case, quality data is probably one of the most important issues to be resolved going ahead, and this is likely to define what companies we will be able to price and influence model selection. Therefore when you (or someone else) examines potential data sources/vendors please keep Eric Kirkpatrick and Mike Mumford in the loop to ensure full co-ordination  Regards  TV      ---------------------- Forwarded by Tomas Valnek/LON/ECT on 18/04/2001 11:25 ---------------------------   Ben Parsons 18/04/2001 08:22 To: Tomas Valnek/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: Data for Moodys RiskCalc  FYI ---------------------- Forwarded by Ben Parsons/LON/ECT on 18/04/2001 08:23 --------------------------- From: Iris Mack/ENRON@enronXgate on 17/04/2001 19:19 CDT To: Craig Chaney/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kim Detiveaux/ENRON@enronXgate cc: Amitava Dhar/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Vasant Shanbhogue/ENRON@enronXgate, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ben Parsons/LON/ECT@ECT, Mike Mumford/LON/ECT@ECT, Scott Salmon/EU/Enron@Enron   Subject: Data for Moodys RiskCalc   Craig and Kim,   As you know,  I have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to Moodys RiskCalc.   You wanted to know if it makes sense for Enron to purchase RiskCalc.   Well, after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through todays 2-hour Moodys presentation, it is necessary for us to have information about Enrons counterparties to move to the next step with RiskCalc.   We have obtained some information on Enrons European counterparties from our colleagues in the London office.   We need for you and/or your colleagues in the Houston office to supply us with a list of Enrons North American counterparties.     More specifically, to evaluate Moodys RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enrons North American (private firm) counterparties:        Fiscal Year The prior twelve months of financial data are represented. Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables, such as cost of goods sold, net income, sales, and EBIT. The value should be a four-digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000. Forecasts until the year 2009 can be made. A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last years (1999) inflation level. In general this estimation error will not cause any great problems, as size affects default rates at very large scales (e.g., $10,000,000 vs. $1,000,000 makes a significant difference, $1,000,000 vs. $1,050,00 does not).   Cash & Equivalents This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities.   Inventory Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet, in thousands dollars, without any alterations for accounting method (e.g., LIFO, FIFO, Average Cost). This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue. Specifically this would include purchase cost, sales cost, sales taxes, transportation costs, insurance costs, and storage costs.  Current Assets This item primarily represents cash, inventories, accounts receivables, marketable securities, and other current assets.   Total Assets Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars. For example, $15,500,000 should be entered as 15500. Specifically, total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property, plant, and equipment plus other noncurrent assets (including intangible assets, deferred items, and investments and advances). Leave previous years total assets blank for Australian companies.   Current Liabilities Liabilities are positive values. Included in current liabilities are short-term debt, accounts payable, and other current liabilities.    Total Liabilities This balance sheet account, total liabilities, is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long-term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities (including deferred taxes, investment tax credit, and minority interest).    Retained Earnings Retained Earnings, a historical measure of performance, is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders. Typically, it is the prior years retained earnings plus net income less distributions. Retained earnings are generally positive. Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings. Leave this field blank for Australian companies.   Sales This item consists of the industry segments gross sales (the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period) reduced by cash discounts, trade discounts, and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers.   Cost of Goods Sold Entered in thousands of dollars, this value is generally a positive number less than sales. It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production, such as material, labor, and overhead. Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Leave this field blank for Australian companies.   EBIT Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation. It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income.   Interest Expense This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short- and long-term debt. Typically, we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities. One measure of computing this is: Interest Expense = 0.07 * total liabilities.    Net Income This item represents the income (or loss) reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations. A loss is represented by a negative sign. For example, a $5,000,000 loss would be entered as -5000. Leave previous years net income blank for Australian companies.     Extraordinary Items Positive or negative, this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement. The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations. These items include extraordinary gains/losses, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and cumulative affect of accounting changes. Expenses are entered as negative values, gains as positive values. Leave previous years extraordinary items blank for Australian companies.    Country This model is calibrated for the United States, Canada, and Australia.     We look forward to receiving this information for Enrons private firm North American counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of RiskCalc.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  EGM Coal & Emissions The November and December NYMEX market remains very tight.  Offers in the O= TC market have climbed to the low $40s.

__label__DontSave	Risk New Update - 26/10/2001 Dear Subscriber,  Welcome to RiskNews Update - 26/10/2001  JP Morgan Chase was in the news this week. First, its US credit derivatives group said it was considering partnerships with affiliated companies and data vendors to redistribute its data and create an industry pricing benchmark. Second, it and Deutsche Bank separately signed deals with US technology solutions provider Longitude to speed the introduction of broader index trading based on economic data.  The idea to create credit derivatives indexes is not new to the bank. Its European operation has already set up a credit default swap data service - albeit that it has received a somewhat underwhelming response from clients, bankers said. But global credit derivatives head Andy Brindle said the US approach would be different to Europe, although he declined to provide more specific details due to the early state of negotiations.  Wider-than-market indexes are also a relatively uncharted territory, but the use of Longitudes Parimutuel Digital Call Auction (PDCA) technology, could be the first step towards banks reducing market risk. PDCA products should be self-clearing and self-hedging, and priced according to customer particpation. They are therefore not dependent on supply and demand constraints. JP Morgan Chase plans to use the technology to create products based on economic statistics published by the US government and US government agencies. Deutsche plans to use Longitude to create derivatives based on economic statistics published by European and Japanese governments.  Meanwhile, Moodys Risk Management Services has formed a strategic working group - the RiskCalc Sponsor Group - with nine major banks, to develop European credit risk benchmarks, using its RiskCalc software. The RiskCalc backers are Barclays, Lloyds TSB, and Royal Bank of Scotland in the UK; Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and Santander Central Hispano (formerly BSCH) in Spain; HypoVereinsbank in Germany; Banco Espirito Santo in Portugal; Fortis Bank in Belgium; and Bank Austria.  On the people front, Barclays Capital, the investment banking division of the UKs Barclays Bank, has named former Chase Securities executive Eileen Murphy as the global head of its new collateralised debt obligation group. Barclays plans to launch a new CDO based on leverage buy-outs by the end of the year.  Finally, on 5-9 November in New York and on 26-30 November in London, Risk magazine will be holding its 3rd annual Maths Week conference. This five-day event will cover the latest research in quantitative finance and risk management, with presentations by leading industry practitioners and academics.

I made some changes for it to fit in with our notation, etc, but apart from that its a fin piece of work. If you could just answer the questions posed by Vince, and send me the final figure then we are a go (all of ours are now finished). Would you be happy with the following?  3.5 Summary  In this chapter we have discussed volatility modelling and estimation in the energy commodity markets, emphasising the difference between this market and financial markets.  We discuss the estimation of volatility from both historical and implied data, again from the perspective of the energy user. We further discussed a number of stochastic volatility models and have shown how to estimate the models via ordinary least squares and maximum likelihood.  We have tested our estimation techniques on a number of examples drawn from energy markets including electricity, gas and crude oil.  Best regards.

He has one more year left in school, but If you are interested, I could  invite him over to talk to our group members, and get a better feel for the Enron Research environment.

I would very much like to talk to your Director about opportunities at Enron.  To be honest, I am approaching Enron from several different points in order to pinpoint the area that best suits my abilities and sense of direction (kind of mirroring the internal process that you would use to move between groups within Enron).  As Enron is the only large corporation that I am seriously considering, talks with people such as yourself are invaluable in helping me find areas of commonality between the companys and my own goals.  Makes for a realistic set of expectations on both sides.  My resume is attached in Word format, but sending emails from home via the Rice server sometimes buggers the attachments.  If you cant open the document, let me know and I will send another copy both from my Roadrunner address as well as directly from school.  Thanks for the help.

__label__Save	Re: VaR for EnronCredit.com Bryan,  We shall be glad to  take a look at the system. To sign - off on the vendor  provided system we have to look under the hood and review the algorithms. I hope the vendor will  have no objections to it.  Another critical issue we have to solve on a short notice is to integrate the  system you want to buy with the rest of VaR/credit systems. We shall stand by to help in this  endeavor.  An alternative approach is to evaluate to what extent your positions can be  rolled into the existing risk systems.

__label__Save	Re: Henwood query Hi Karolina,  Yes, it might be more productive to talk on the phone.  Given our time  difference, why dont we plan on tomorrow (Friday) 8:00AM PDT, 4:00PM BDT?   My number in the states is 503-464-8430.  Give me your number, too, so that I  can call back if I get hung up in a meeting or something.  The situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the  capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour, but  in constructing the stack, increments of a plant may be scattered throughout  the stack, based on their respective incremental heat rates.  (This is why  increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model.)  Results for  the capacity increments, however, are not available as output; only each  plants aggregate values are reported.  I had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a  Homer City, NY plant we were studying a few years ago.  Attached is the SQL  query you can import into MS ACCESS to do the same thing for you (making  appropriate modifications to the year, hour, etc.)  Unfortunately, no Henwood  documentation on the output variables existed when I created this query, so I  can not really tell you what they represent anymore.  An acquaintance of mine  at Entergy and I were lobbying to get Henwood to provide some documentation,  so it may be available now.  Lets talk and maybe we can help you out, Michael  >>> Karolina Potter/LON/ECT@ENRON 08/24/00 07:08AM >>> Michael,  I am an analyst in Paul Meads Continental Power Trading group in London. I  am currently working on the project, which requires the use of EMSS, and  experience some difficulties interpreting the output results. Steven Leppard  from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and  consequently the person to contact in case of problems.  I have been running simulations for the Dutch market and was asked to provide  the traders with some front-end screen graphs in order to interpret the  numerical results. One of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack  and systems marginal cost, as we only run cost based scenarios. To sort each  stations hourly generation I need its marginal cost. To my knowledge though,  marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit (TransArea  Marginal Units query, Marg_cost unit). Therefore I was sorting the stations  according to the cost which I calculated based on the outputs from Station  Detail by Hour query. The calculation was as follows:  For each hour, for each generating station:  marginal cost [o/MWh] = (Generation_Cost [o000] * 1000)/Generation [MWh] -  VOM_cost [o/MWh]  This I thought would include fuel cost and start up costs. However, a  marginal station which I get on the stack as a result of the above  calculation is not a station given in Marginal Station field in TransArea  Marginal Units query. I have also looked into TransArea_Data_Hr table and  TransArea_Data table but non of the costs there match my results.  Do you happen to know what formula is used to determine Marg_cost and which  outputs I should be using to obtain the right results?  It might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone. In this case  could you please send me your direct telephone number. I am struggling  understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much.

With so many options on the market, it can be difficult for customers and ASPs to pick the right kinds of security for storage and transmission of sensitive corporate information.  Perhaps the ideal security product for ASPs is one that gives customers the most comfort, is reasonably cost-effective, and can be managed by a staff that may not be expert in security.  The toughest part for ASPs is that their customers hold them to a security double standard. These customers often expect better security for their remotely hosted systems and data than they provide for their local systems.  I find this ironic, considering most security infractions occur from inside an organization, not outside. Conventional wisdom places the percentage of breaches at 80% internal, and 20% external (though I havent independently verified these statistics).  Based on that information, I would think customers considering an ASP model for applications and data would be stumbling over one another to locate their systems at an ASP, thus reducing their exposure to system compromises.  Instead, prospective customers typically hit the ASP with security questions that may not be outside the expertise of the ASP in question and may be only marginally understood by the customers themselves. ASP business development staff have to become versed in the technology workings of VPNs for data transfer and public-key infrastructure for authentication and encryption, for example, just so they can get in the door with a potential customer.  Unfortunately, comprehensive security procedures and technologies are typically very expensive to implement and require a level of security expertise that most ASPs cannot hope to implement and maintain. And Im not so sure these technology answers are really solving the problem of security for ASPs and their customers. Again, 80% of security breaches come from the inside. In a lot of cases, that means that the true threat is from people who are already inside the security demilitarized zones. It seems to me that security technology is really only part of the answer to the overall security question.  In my opinion, ASPs and large enterprises should look beyond the latest security technology and hire security experts from the Department of Defense, NSA or the CIA who can help implement security policies and procedures that will be effective in eliminating the 80% internal breaches.  There are several documented systems, publicly available from the government, that outline the policies and procedures necessary to meet certain levels of security. For example, there is a series of trusted systems books available from INFOSEC, each named after a color: the Teal Book, the Orange Book, and the Bright Blue Book, all of which are great resources for a variety of security topics.  No doubt, there are some commercial enterprises that also adhere to recognized security standards and can provide the procedures and technology necessary to ensure the integrity of critical business information inside and outside corporate networks. Partnerships between ASPs and these emerging companies would make a lot of sense.  I dont mean to exclude technology solutions from this discussion. I believe that there are significant strides being made to make security technology more usable and affordable. But I fear that ASPs are setting up service-level agreements with their customers that guarantee certain levels of security and intrusion detection, but are really only covering the most visible problem.

__label__Save	Credit Model Vince and Stinson,  We met Bill Bradford yesterday, the credit model modification turns out to be  three projects.  1) Potential exposure calculator        This requres forward curves simulation and revaluation of all deals over  the tenor (typically 20 years).    It needs multi-factor HJM and gas-electricity joint factors of loading.   Output from this model is the maximal loss amount and    its confidence interval.      Expected delivery time: 1 month  2) Include Asian option model into the current XLL calculation engine.      This is more concrete and simly to do.      Expected delivery time: 2 weeks.  3) Incorporate Krishnas EAM option valuation into the credit model      This one is not yet urgent.   I may need more resources to accomplish these tasks.   Paulo has difficulty  to commit himself to even to the second task,  citing that he has other things to do.  Therefore I need your help in setting  the prorities.

__label__Save	Dhabol Jeff,  We shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from Sandeep with the  numbers you have  requested.  What follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on  the power situation in India published by The Financial Times.   The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting  millions of people. One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of  output lost due  to  power shortages. It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost  of power produced by the Dhabol plant (expensive as it may be). The power cut affected 230  million people.  The second article is Enron specific.  Vince                                            ASIA-PACIFIC: Power failure hits north India                       Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001                      By ANGUS DONALD                       Tens of millions of people were left without electricity  in northern India                      yesterday after a power grid breakdown.                        Electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and  most parts of the                      capital New Delhi, with 60 to 70 per cent of supply  expected to be restored                      by the end of the day, according to power grid  officials.                        The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry  (Assocham), a                      leading business organisation, expressed deep concern  and called for a                      mechanism to prevent future disruption that could  cripple the economy.                        The power failure across eight Indian states, including  New Delhi, disrupted                      train services, water supplies and the telephone network  and forced                      hospitals to switch to emergency generators.                        The fault occurred on the Northern Grid, which provides  electricity for 226m                      people, and affected the states of Delhi, Haryana,  Punjab, Uttar Pradesh,                      Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu  and Kashmir.                        A breakdown at a sub-station in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh,  Indias most                      populous state, caused an overload of power on other  lines, which then                      failed as well.                        Trains stopped running for most of the day and signals  systems were                      damaged. New Delhi international airport was also  slightly affected before                      its own power supply could be engaged.                        We will probe into the reasons for the failure. It is  most likely to be a                      technical failure, but we will investigate why it  happened, Suresh Prabhu,                      the power minister, was quoted as saying by Press Trust  of India.                        India suffers regularly from power problems because of  lack of funding to                      upgrade infrastructure. Theft of supplies is also a big  problem. Thirty per                      cent of the countrys electricity is stolen, according  to analysts. In New                      Delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen.                        Two years ago, a power failure blacked out Uttar Pradesh  and Delhi for                      hours.                        Assocham issued a statement, saying that increasing  industrial demand                      would exacerbate the problems already faced by Indias  inefficient power                      sector. The slow progress, particularly in  strengthening the transmission                      and distribution system, and ever increasing theft will  contribute to                      worsening the power supply situation further.

Its myth and reality offensive in local newspapers  follows the west Indian                      state of Maharashtras decision to review the tariff it  pays the Texas-based                      company, whose Dollars 2.2bn electricity generating  plant at Dabhol is                      Indias biggest single foreign investment.                        Maharashtras tariff has more than doubled since 1993  and is three times                      greater than that charged by other independent power  producers (IPPs).                      The tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the  rupee against the                      dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha  fuel. The state also pays                      a fixed capacity charge of Rs970m (Dollars 21m) a month,  reflecting the                      huge project cost and, controversially, irrespective of  consumption.                        A showdown looks inevitable, reminiscent of a clash six  years ago that                      damaged Indias appeal to foreign investors. A former  official of the World                      Bank, which has criticised the deal, says Enron is  emerging as the East                      India Company of the 21st century - a reference to the  British trader that                      colonised key areas of the Indian economy in the 19th  century.                        The stand-off is the latest blot on Indias power  sector. The UKs PowerGen                      and Cogentrix of the US have quit India recently,  frustrated by long approval                      procedures, inadequate payments mechanisms or because of  higher                      returns elsewhere.                        India has lost time and opportunity and has driven  returns down by six                      percentage points, says Gerry Grove-White, former India  general manager                      of PowerGen, which has sold its 655MW plant in Gujarat  to China Light &                      Power of Hong Kong.                        Indias national plan for the five years to 2002 says  generating capacity                      must rise by 40,000MW to about 120,000MW. But since  1992, IPPs have                      added only 3,000MW and 2,500MW remains under  construction. This is                      insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8  per cent economic                      growth.                        Enron was a bellwether of Indias liberalisation,  winning fast-track project                      approval in the early 1990s. Phase 1, a 740MW plant  fuelled by expensive                      naphtha came on stream in May 1999, and phase 2, a  Dollars 1.87bn plant                      of 1,624MW capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied  natural gas (LNG),                      will be completed this year. Only two of seven other  fast-track proposals                      have achieved financial closure.                        From the outset Enron encountered attacks, culminating  in Maharashtras                      then nationalist government cancelling the project  before renegotiating                      terms no less onerous. Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister  of the successor                      government, says the power purchase agreement is  unaffordable.                        Enron, whose attackers also include cultural  chauvinists, wants to maintain                      good political relations in a hostile but lucrative  environment. Enron views                      India as a testing ground for its evolution from a  traditional manager of                      power plants to a broad-based trader of commodities,  such as energy, gas                      and bandwidth.                        To support these ambitions Enron hopes to trade energy  between power                      surplus and deficit states, once legislation is passed  this year. It is building                      an LNG terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural  gas. And it is                      laying a 15,000km fibre-optic network to trade bandwidth  space in a country                      desperately short of this new economy commodity.                        In any event, Enron believes it has a watertight  contract. It is supported by                      many that believe any subversion of the contract would  confirm investor                      perception of Maharashtra, Indias financial and  industrial hub, as an                      unreliable destination for investment.                        Mr Deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his  predecessor, which                      threatened to dump Dabhol into the Arabian Sea - is  under pressure from                      radical members of his wobbly coalition. But his options  are limited.                      Scrapping the project would be ruinous for an  economically troubled state                      that would have to compensate shareholders.                        Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the local utility  and Enrons main                      client, is obliged to dispatch or off-take 90 per cent  of Dabhols output. Yet                      MSEB has never honoured these guarantees. Its off-take  has averaged 60                      per cent since the plant opened and, in effect, MSEB has  been paying a lot                      more while consuming a lot less power.                        One reason off-take is low is because the states tough  new regulator has                      told MSEB to buy from cheaper sources. Enron says the  tariff would be                      Rs4.02/kWh if MSEBs off-take averaged 90 per cent. But  with off-take a                      third lower, the average tariff is Rs4.94 per unit, and  often higher. In                      October, the tariff was Rs6.91 per unit, when off-take  was about 49 per                      cent. Enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2,  run on cheaper                      LNG, starts.                        These cost pressures have forced MSEB to take up only  half of a 30 per                      cent equity option in phase 2. Enron has acquired the  balance and                      mandated bankers to find a buyer.                        Enrons difficulties have undermined the appeal of IPPs,  which have failed to                      deliver the flood of investments. Potential IPPs feared  they would never be                      paid by state generating boards that have become a  byword for corrupt                      management of power.                        Reform of state electricity boards, whose uneconomic  pricing means                      industrial users subsidise poor farmers, as well as  transmission and                      distribution (T&D) services to check huge theft and  technical losses, is                      overdue. Given the limited resources, money would be  better spent on T&D                      rather than on new plant, says Oliver Blackaby,  managing director of N M                      Rothschild in India, which is advising Karnataka on the  privatisation of its                      distribution network.                        For the moment, attention is fixed on Enrons ability to  satisfy the                      competing interests of investors and clients. As Sanjay  Bhatnagar, chief                      executive officer of Enron India, said in a recent trade  magazine, one of the                      key lessons learned from phase 2 is having flexibility  to deal with                      externalities.

Vince  ---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 04/23/2001  09:28 AM ---------------------------   Nelson Neale@ENRON 04/20/2001 10:29 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vasant Shanbhogue/Enron@EnronXGate cc:   Subject: Petrochem Desk  I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to  curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in  April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at  construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or  SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of  the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked  about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that theyd only been  around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John  Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.     From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at  least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to  understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday  during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX  component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could  then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors  (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

__label__Save	MG Metals: Additional Areas to Look at Dear Lloyd & Richard,  I have been discussing with Eric Gadd about two particular areas of concern  that will affect the London Research Group.  I believe there are a number of  issues to address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk  management and quantitative analysis perspective, and I have put together a  (by no means exhaustive) list:-  i) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic  options linking perspective (e.g. their spreadsheets link to different option  pricing add-ins) ii) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we  can capture metals risk in our VaR system (we will require historical data  for this).  I am sure Bjorn will be looking to the Research Group to assist  in this matter. iii) ensure that MG staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our  methods and systems and vice versa  These tasks will involve a significant degree of cross-communication with  relevant contacts within MG metals, and so I look forward to starting on the  process as soon as possible - I hope to play a full part from a quantitative  research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes  smoothly in this exciting new development, so please do not hesitate to  involve me.

They are also interested in any trend information we can devise.  Links between ENSO or other large scale oscillations that could have long range effects.  Tony has already given their group a 101 course on ENSO and its impacts on these areas.  3) They would eventually like daily AM briefings - along with a daily product related to their market (ie precip/temp graphs etc)  4) They do not begin actually trading for another 6 to 8 weeks - so we have some time to experiment with the type of support that fits them best.  Tony and I agree that we would like to brainstorm this a bit with you guys to see what exactly can be produced daily - as efficiently as possible.  We should be able to add any lat/long points we want to the list of international cities streaming through from the MRF/AVN/ECMWF from EarthSat.  The problems here would be the models problems handling tropical weather along with specific local effects - especially in Indonesia.

Sign up today at: http://nww1.com/go/foc69.html ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Todays Focus: Aggregation of storage --------------------------------------------------------------- By Anne Skamarock  There are several ways vendors are allowing for aggregation of storage, and even though they all use the word aggregation, the word means different things to different companies.  The prospect of aggregating storage devices is intriguing, but it raises several questions.  How much storage can I aggregate, or logically collect, for ease of management, yet make it available to my business applications with a performance appropriate to the environment?  By the way, once I have all this storage, how do I manage it easily?  And does all of the storage have to be of the same type/class, or even from the same vendor?  Also, in a perfect world, I would be able to define the quality of service needed for my business application and data handling and it would all just happen.  But we dont live in a perfect world - yet.  One company selling the ability to aggregate storage is XIOtech.  XIOtechs Magnitude storage subsystem allows customers to aggregate disks on a volume basis.  What this means is the server system attached to the Magnitude subsystem will see the disk volume that is presented to it.  Using virtualization, the disk volume that is presented to the world looks like a normal disk volume when in fact it could be made up of pieces of many different disks within the Magnitude chassis or on many different Magnitude subsystems linked together.  The software that allows for the virtual presentation of volumes is located within the Magnitude subsystem.  XIOtech has partnered with Veritas to gain high performance and functionality on the server side, in growing these aggregations of disk with no downtime to a business application. Installation of the Magnitude subsystem requires an administrator to answer two or three questions, and takes just 10 minutes.  XIOtech has a leg up on the competition in its technology, but because this is a fairly new company with only one base product, one size must fit all.  In reality, customers need to be able to choose the appropriate price/performance characteristics of their storage and match it with their business applications.  And wouldnt it be nice to have only one storage-management environment for the whole enterprise, from very small to very large storage?  Last week, Tivoli announced a new initiative code-named Storage Tank (where did they get that name?).  This initiative goes a long way in addressing end-to-end storage management, if Tivoli can pull it off.  While the Storage Tank initiative spans all areas of storage-area network (SAN) management, aggregation is a large part of this initiative as well. Within a SAN appliance that would interoperate with agents located on server systems, Tivoli plans to implement capabilities similar to what XIOtech has today.  Again, using virtualization, the SAN appliance would present storage groups (logical volumes) to the servers.  The one advantage this architecture has over storage subsystem- based implementations is it is both server- and storage-vendor agnostic.  Theoretically, you can have many different storage subsystems behind the virtualization layer to present to your business applications, running on many heterogeneous servers as you please.  You could, in effect, manage an entire enterprises storage from one place, obtaining storage that was appropriate for the business need, when you need it.  This is an admirable goal.  I think the road will be rocky for Tivoli for several reasons. The interoperability testing for verifying that different storage subsystems play well together is a huge task.  Ease of installation, configuration and reconfiguration will be issues as well.  Will current Tivoli agents need to be upgraded?  How much will that cost?  Will I have to pay consultants every time I want to trade out a subsystem for something new?  Even though Storage Tank holds great promise, it is impossible to know if it will live up to that promise because it is not available today.  You will continue to hear the terms aggregation and virtualization when talking with storage and storage management vendors.  These concepts not only promise to make managing the plethora of storage that is, or soon will be, part of your enterprise much easier. But they also start to move into the realm of business data and information management, the true goal of businesses.

__label__Save	 Vince and Vasant:  Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at  the East Desk, related to gas transmission:  Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example  might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay  $12.00 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed  payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs (shrinkage) and 6.5% for  overhead expenses.  A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a  delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 (basis), and might call Brooklyn  and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 .  The traders spread is  $0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would  offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow.   As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have  an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity.  Also, many pipelines dont discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum  (its not worth their time to haggle) (There is a further issue of  secondary markets not important to the model yet).  For South Texas and  Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take  (pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc).  And, once the trade is in the  system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline,  in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.

__label__Save	P+ option valuation model Mark,  After recently reviewing the booking of the P+ options, it is my understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are assumed to be correlated Geometric Brownian Motion processes  (i.e. the price process assumptions are consistent with standard Black-76 model assumptions extended to two commodities).    The payoff for a call option is:  Payoff = Max( 0,  A - B - K).  Where:  A = NXWTI (delivery price for Nymex)  B = Posting Price = (WTI Swap) - (Posting Basis)  K= Posting Bonus (fixed).  The only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options is that leg B of the spread is a combination of three prices,  the two futures prices which make up the WTI swap for the given month, and the average posting basis during the delivery month.   Combination of these prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg B and the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of prices and its correlation with the NXWTI price.  I believe that this approach is more straightforward than the alternative, which would be to use a three or four-commodity model with its associated volatility and correlation matrices.  In summary, I believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of these types of options, assuming that the inputs are set correctly.  Regards,  Stinson Gibner V. P.

The following plot shows NYMEX curve as of 8/23/00:     For short term, NYMEX moved up compared to that of 8/22/00, while the long  term NYMEX moved down.  Here are the tenor for each deal:  Deal 1:   start 01-Sep-00, end 22-May-09,    the above graph suggested a  positve fuel P/L Deal 2:   start 01-sep-00, end 28-feb-02,       the above graph suggested a  small negative P/L Deal 25: start 01-may-02, end 28-feb-09,      the above graph suggested a  positve fuel P/L Deal 26: start 01-mar-09, end 31-may-09,    the above graph suggested a  positve fuel P/L  The transport book seems to be correct on these fuel P/Ls.   Another point worth to mention is that the fuel cost is related to index  price (NYMEX+basis+index premium), to correctly interpret fuel P/L, we need to look at the index curve change.

Hes extremely interested in moving to Enron,  and accepts that our work is far less academic than his postdoc research,  although far broader than his investment banking quant experience.  He  remains interested, and emphasised he wants to stay close to the traders, but  wants to look at new markets and products.  I think we should seriously  consider hiring him.  He is (understandably) reluctant to move to Houston,  but theres no doubt that there is plenty of (unnmet) demand for derivatives  pricing (and thinking) here in London.  Would you be interested in my setting up a videoconference in the next couple  of weeks so you have a chance to chat with him?  Im meeting with him again  on Tuesday at an academic quant finance seminar organised by Lane at Kings  College.  Ive attached his CV for your reference.

I forgot that the recording of dates in the UK is different from the way it is recorded in the US.  The date on Geoges document is 04/10/00, i.e., October 4, 2000.     Again, Jeff stated that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to sort out the public firm model issues.  Until then, I am busy trying to develop the private firm model - which is the deliverable we promised to Enron Credit (as stated in the Elaboration Document I sent last week).

The meeting summary addresses testing only briefly in saying be aware of the time dimension which is obvious and has been addressed by adding more equity driven ratios as well as our plan to add a time dimension to capture ratings momentum following a downgrade.      Perhaps you didnt understand my specific request for any ideas you might have to assist in model testing and also for an update on the Duffie report.  We still have not seen any drafts of what you learned.  As Im sure you recall, the teleconference with Vince, Vasant, and Amitava focused exclusively on private firm models, the scope of the project, and data acquisition considerations.  After the call, you suggested to Bryan, Eric, Mike and I that your report would include many of the issues in Georges 2 documents (movement model and meeting summary).  My personal hope, echoed by Bryan at that time, was that your report might be more insightful since the movement model, as you surely learned in your visit, is in its infancy and only one portion of the modelling effort and the meeting summary covered the most basic issues with minimal detail.      I sincerely want to establish a solid relationship with Houston Research and hope we can move forward together in a coordinated, team-oriented approach.  I look forward to discussing it with you at our Tuesday teleconference.  Best regards, Scott  FYI - George joined the company in Sep 2000 so could not have written the Movement Model proposal in April 2000.

Thanks for your email.   I can appreciate your concerns about the public firm models, but am at a loss for what more I can say that has not already been said.    Recall that during my recent trip to London, we had a conference call with Houston research, you, Bryan, Mike and Eric.  During this conference call Vince, Vasant, Amitava and I pointed out some of the issues with the public firm models and the data used to develop these models.     In addition, after that conference call you, Bryan, Mike, Eric and I had further discussions as to how to sort out the public firm models.  During this discussion we all agreed that most of these issues had already been raised and addressed by George Albanis in the following documents:   1.  EnronCredit.com Project Proposal - Movement Model and Parallel Work - Phases IV,  by George Albanis, December 2000   2.  Meeting 25/01/2001 - Review, by George Albanis.     I also forwarded copies of these documents to you and Ben via email on May 11th.  Just in case you cant find them, I will forward them again.   Based on recent discussions with Jeff Kinneman, it is my understanding that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to figure out how to repair the public firm models.  Hence it may be more appropriate to direct any future concerns about the public firm models to their attention.

If you havent sent the report to him yet, perhaps we can request his opinions on best practices for testing models with limited quality out of sample test sets.  Obviously, Id like to discuss this in detail with you as well, especially since you understand the characteristics of the models and data better now, but Ill do that via phone.  Im hoping there are some statistical techniques were currently ignoring that we can employ to maximize the testing we do and get a better handle on judging our accuracy.  If youve got some time Tuesday after our meeting where Mike catches us up on the D&B issues, Id love to get your views as the model testbed is now in place and were starting a model recalbration phase.  Im least comfortable about our plans for stress testing the models once weve recalibrated them.  Looking forward to talking to you Tuesday.

__label__Save	Interesting Article about Enron in Japans Electricity Newspaper Japans Electricity Newspaper (Denki Shimbun, the equivalent of Megawatt  Daily) has been running a series of articles about the new century.  Several  of these have focused on the power industry in the U.S.  A friend of mine ran  across one on Enron that was published on April 13 and sent it to me.  I  thought you would find it interesting.  The article focuses on EES in particular and about how we try to succeed by  being first to meet our clients changing needs.  It also describes how we  use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive.   The article also briefly mentions the new office in Japan.  The most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is  about Enron.  Given what I have read and heard about how nervous the Japanese  are about deregulation of the industry, I really did not expect such praise.  Denki Shimbun also has a web site at www.shimbun.denki.or.jp.  They have  small summaries of the important articles of the day (the site, however, is  completely in Japanese).  Another interesting site is  www.criepi.denken.or.jp, the English home site of Japans Central Research  Institute of Electric Power Industry (Denryoku Chuo Kenkyuujou).  The site  has many links to other English-language sites related to the power industry  in Japan.

__label__Save	California Update 5/22/01 PLEASE TREAT AS CONFIDENTIAL  A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  Here are the main points from their conversation  1. Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt  Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that he was surprised they hadnt already.  He noted that the only reason they havent yet is that they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent and that their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it.  He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the Plan Bs are speculative at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court.  2. Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough  Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didnt issue more is that Angelides felt that $12B was all the market could handle.  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptrollers Kathleen Connells office.  3. New Generator Construction  Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be 5-10% short on power all summer.

How is Wednesday at 2:30?  I did look at EOL and am not surprised to see its quality. I was unable to say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because of deadline pressures. How is the site doing? I am intrigued by the competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that Goldman, Morgan, BP and Shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours. Talk about a shotgun marriage!  If we have time next week, I could step you through our website -- www.weathereffects.com. Im very proud of what weve done. I cant give out a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the phone using my password. Its a very ambitious site -- with state-of-the-art WSI weather (seasonal, 6-10, and day to day) driving a good load model for PJM and NEPOOL. ESAI contributes oil and gas input price forecasts, capacity judgments, and herding ideas to develop power price forecasts for same time periods. After one months full-bore effort, Im pleased with the results (e.g., we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $43 and it turned out $46).  Have a great weekend.

__label__DontSave	Thank You For Your Time and Hospitality Vincent....on behalf  of Toshiba Corporation, we wanted to thank you for the valuable time you spent  with us on Tuesday and also for the great Brennans Lunch!   We hope you and your  team felt that the time was well spent and you found the Boltzmann concepts and  model to be both interesting and compelling.   We know that we  threw alot of very detailed information at you in a relatively small amount of  time and of course it will take some time to digest.   Were thinking that  the best way forward may be a small research or prototype project where Enron  and Toshiba may be able to jointly test, analyze and benchmark the application  of this concept -- to determine its feasibility and potential business  benefit.  We are very interested in your thoughts about this  idea.   We have  attached the 2 briefings that were given for your use and internal distribution  as appropriate.  We have also attached other potentially useful information  (published papers, etc.) for your use as you attempt to better understand  the Boltzmann Model and underlying concepts.   Thanks again and we  look forward to the opportunity for mutually beneficial collaboration between  Toshibas eSolutions Company and ENRON.   Sincerely,   Tom Murphy        Thomas J.

__label__DontSave	new bldg- book space- library? Vince-  Are you going over to the new building right away?  The reason I ask is on the trading floor the workspaces are very small, and there is no room whatsoever for books (eg, econometrics texts).  I think this revives the issue of a library. We used to have a wonderful one, then it went away.  I was wondering if you could keep a thought in the back of your mind in terms of a place where people could go to find and read good textbooks.

Based on your comments here would be my proposal  o63,500 basic salary -  o15K kickers for each of the 2 years - These are paid as a lump sum on each  anniversary guaranteed.  Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 -  this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus Increase the value of options to o60K  to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a  1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.    Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so  this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.    Let me know your thoughts.

__label__Save	Energy Derivatives Book Hi Vince,  It was good to speak to you and Grant the other day.  Plese find attached a block of 3 chapters that are basically the middle of the book. This should give you an idea at the level it is pitched - although these are probably some of the the most technical of the chapters. Julie who works for us will be getting in contact with you soon to chase you up on your chapter!  Ive asked Julie to have a chat to you about a couple of other things at the same time. I hope this is OK with you. Julie and I will be making a trip thru Houston around the third week of February to try and visit some energy companies. Its mainly a fact finding trip to see what the energy companies are doing and how we might be able to make use of our skills in a commercial sense. Would you recommend any people we should talk too? Also we will be running a course on energy derivatives in Houston at the end of March following the success of the course in New York last year and want to advertise this. Do you know of people who would be interested in such a course?

__label__DontSave	Dilbert Newsletter 38.0 Dilbert Newsletter 38.0 -----------------------   To:     Dogberts New Ruling Class (DNRC) From:   Scott Adams (scottadams@aol.com) Date:   November 2001    Highlights ------------------------------------------------- * Scotts Patriotic Duty * Boss and Cow-orker Quotes * Holiday Gift Ideas * True Tales of Induhviduals -------------------------------------------------   DNRC Update -----------  There are 400,000 people in the DNRC, each more attractive, generous and intelligent than those who do not read the free Dilbert Newsletter. Maybe thats a coincidence, but Im starting to doubt it.  My Patriotic Duty -----------------  Ive been wondering about the best way to offer my patriotic services in this time of global conflict. I dont think Id be a good candidate for Special Ops. Id be the one with the wheeled carry-on bag saying, Hey, guys, I have sand in my shoe! Is anyone else hungry? Can I use my flashlight now?  Im already donating money to patriotic causes, and I bought some plastic flags made in China, but I felt I needed to do more. Then it hit me. There is one patriotic duty for which I have prepared my entire life: dehumanizing the enemy. In a sense, thats been my full-time job for years. I just need to replace the word management with Taliban. So lets get started.  Ive been trying to figure out the Talibans long-term strategy and I think I got it: Theyre trying to reverse evolution. Their uncontrolled body hair is a good start. Living in caves was an obvious step too.  The hard part was eliminating any trace of intelligence in the children. But theyve made great strides in that area. Have you seen the video of the Taliban schools where the little kids squat on the floor and rock back and forth chanting all day? No math, no social studies, just rocking and chanting. For PE they use sticks to whack stuffed dummies labeled Bush and Blair. Im not sure how they know how to spell Bush and Blair. On any given morning theyre probably whacking dummies labeled Tqwft and Upxpgt but its a good aerobic workout either way.  Just for fun, ask yourself what part of the Taliban curriculum could NOT be accomplished by, for example, a monkey: Rocking back and forth? Chanting? Beating a dummy with a stick? Even if a monkey only got a D in chanting, he would still graduate with honors from a Taliban school thanks to his high overall grades in rocking and whacking.  As I write this, our generals are trying to figure out how to get the Taliban out of their caves. Theyre running sophisticated war game scenarios and calculating risks and gathering intelligence. I have one word for them:                         bananas  I dont want my patriotic words misconstrued as ethnic or religious insults. As soon as the evildoers stop doing evil, I am willing to promote them to full-fledged Induhviduals and insult them on equal footing with everyone else who doesnt read the Dilbert Newsletter.  Now that weve dehumanized the Taliban, lets get on to the important work of dehumanizing our bosses, cow-orkers and family members.   Induhvidual Confusion ---------------------  Some topics seem to confuse Induhviduals more than others. For example, they seem to have special trouble with concepts involving wildlife, vision and their own pants. See for yourself in these true quotes from Induhvidual bosses and Cow-orkers, submitted by DNRC members:  ---  A VP was speaking at a meeting and said, Well, you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him crap. Someone up front said, Thats drink...cant make him drink.  To which the VP said, Thats stupid.  ---  In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed horse is king!  ---  A cow-orker once said, Looks like hes thrown a wrench in the monkeyworks.  ---  A two-prawn approach is necessary.  ---  Here is a mangled expression the CIO at our company told me the other day. We were discussing an issue we both agreed upon and he said I was preaching to the blind.  ---  He wont last, hes just a flash in the pants.  ---  One of the employees called in to say that she couldnt come to work because she ...had to have an autopsy.  ---  My boss was telling a very involved story about something that happened to him. He leaned back nonchalantly and offered as a philosophical summary: Sometimes fact is stranger than truth.  ---  Its a catch 20-20.  ---  Our former boss suffered from the excessive use of mixed metaphors. An all-time howler was the day we asked him what his plans were to ensure success for a campaign and his reply was Dont worry; Ive got an ace up my hole.  ---  At a management meeting, my CEO said, Our company is like a living orgasm. Now thats what I call job satisfaction.  ---  I overheard a manager congratulating an Induhvidual on having achieved a goal. The Induhvidual replied, It was nothing. You planted the seed, and I ran with it.  --- In a meeting a cow-orker of mine referred to the carrot at the end of the tunnel.  ---  We are going to be shooting from the seat of our pants on this one.  ---  These all came from the same boss:  Vision is in the eyes of the beholder.  Part of the verbiage is a language thing.  Eventually, I want it now.  Its not that kind of zero.  There are a lot of areas for efficiency reductions.  In the last year, youve turned around 150%.  ---  When a high-powered agent of the company walked into the lunch room, our secretary remarked to our group that she couldnt stand him because he was so ego-testicle.  One of my cow-orkers spit coffee out of his nose, which just added to the moment.  ---  I think you might have hit the nail on the button.  ---  ...caught between a rock and a wet spot.  ---  And my nomination for scariest thing a boss ever said:  I was thinking about you in the shower this morning and I thought of a name for you.    IMVironment on Yahoo! ---------------------  Get the downloadable IM chat environment for Yahoo! featuring the Dilbert characters at http://www.dilbert.com.   Holiday Gift Ideas ------------------  When Im not slaving away writing FREE Dilbert Newsletters for you, I sometimes make holiday gift recommendations. I believe a gift should acknowledge the recipients unique personality and interests. Thats why I organized these suggestions by personality defect.   For Heathens, Vulcans, Skeptics and Dogmatics: ----------------------------------------------  My first non-Dilbert book, Gods Debris (now in hardcover), is full of thought experiments about souls, free will and science that will have your friends and family arguing with each other for weeks. Combine the book with alcoholic beverages and there might even be some slapping.  The book is designed to fit in a stocking and to look as if you put more thought into the gift than you really did. Imagine how smart youll seem when you say, I found all the errors in reasoning. Im sure you will too.  We probably didnt print enough copies of Gods Debris for the holiday season (really) - its way more popular than I expected -- so if its meant to be a gift, act now. Get several for your smart friends or get just one and let people borrow it.  You can find Gods Debris at:  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740721909/unitedmedia/107-5126509-7932516   People With Short Attention Spans: ----------------------------------  I recommend the Dilbert Page-A-Day Calendar for people who cant handle more than 10 seconds per day of any one type of entertainment. For more severe cases of attention deficit, consider the monthly wall calendar or the weekly planner.  Imagine the look on the face of the lucky recipient, full of unmitigated joy and boundless appreciation for your gift-giving brilliance.  You can find these calendars at the following links:  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715674/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715712/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715690/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555   People Who Are Hard To Shop For: --------------------------------  I recommend my new book, When Did Ignorance Become a Point of View? Its a compilation of Dilbert comics that wont clash with anyones home decorations or wardrobe. And it shows thoughtfulness because everyone you know has either had a job or knows someone who has.  Tip: When its being unwrapped say, Youll like this unless youre dead inside. That prevents most people from complaining, which is similar to being happy.  This book is available at:  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740718398/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555   For Dyslexics: --------------  For dyslexics (like me) I recommend the or Calendar Day-A-Page Dilbert, my book Debris Gods, my and book, When Become Did a Point of Ignorance View.  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715674/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555  http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/shop/   People Who Stand Too Close: ---------------------------  Dilbert mints, featuring Manage-Mints, Improve-Mints, Accomplish-mints and Pay-mints are now available at:  http://www.candy2you.com/store/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=CS&Category_Code=D&Affiliate=Dilbert.  The mints are good for people who like tasty mints or bad puns or collecting little tin containers for who-knows-what purpose.   Plop, The Hairless Elbonian ---------------------------  Over the summer I was experimenting with a Dilbert spin-off comic strip about a little boy and his pig growing up in the clueless country of Elbonia. Unfortunately this isnt a good time to launch a comic featuring people who look like the Taliban. So its on the shelf, probably permanently.  You can see the experimental strips at:  http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/plop/  Let me know what you think.    True Tales of Induhviduals --------------------------  Here now, more true tales of Induhviduals, as submitted by members of the DNRC.  The story in your last newsletter about the kid named Ampersand reminded me of another version I heard recently.  One of my relatives met a woman who wanted to call her kid LATRINE.  It took me an hour to stop laughing long enough to ask if anybody had pointed out what a latrine is.  They had. She was apparently still intent on using it.  ---  When I received my new credit card, it had the number two (2) after my name instead of Roman numeral II as it should have, indicating that my name is the same as my fathers.  I called the banks customer service number and asked that their records be changed to use the Roman numeral two (II) instead of the number two (2).  The customer service rep said, Im sorry, sir.  My computer doesnt have Roman numerals.  ---  I just went to see the Cirque du Soleil. During one performance, where a man and woman were flying around by having scarves under their arms attached to this huge wheel thing in the air while doing complicated acrobatics at the same time, an Induhvidual behind me said to her companion, That must take a lot of practice.  ---  At my bookstore a customer returned three of Shakespeares books because, The DARN things are in the form of PLAYS!  ---  At the grocery store, the checkout woman scanned all of my items then picked up the rubber divider and looked it over for the bar code so she could scan it.  She asked, Do you know how much this is?  I said, Ive changed my mind, I dont think Ill buy that today.  She said, Okay. I paid her and left.   Dilbert Fodder ---------------  Whats bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.  The best comic fodder involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations of dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended management consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.  And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.  And if youre seeing any new management trends that need to be mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at scottadams@aol.com.

__label__Save	Re: Storage Model: Simple Issues Brad,  Here are my thoughts on your concerns.  * You needs curve inputs.  This is an IT job.  I can help you for the curves  before the system is properly set up.  * Intrinsic value vs Time value:    The intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes.  If you have a  rough idea about the allocation as   you did in the spreadsheet, we can calucate the intrinsic value within the  model.    The difference between the    total and the intrinsic will be the (option) time value. However, by  pre-allocating volumes, you killed some options.      In the storage model, volumes are allocated dynamically, therefore it is  hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs. time value.   * Factor of loading:  Factor of loadings are used to give historical  correlation matrix. The three factors correspond to   paralle shift, slopping and curveture.  The covariance matrix in the model  is expressed in the form         COVAR = row( vol_{i} ) *( Correl(i,j) )* Colum( vol_{j} ) where vols are  the implied volatilities from the vol curve.      (Correl (i,j)) =L*L +residue (small)    where L is the factor of loading matrix.  So in a simple words, the factor of  loadings (say, 60x3) are a simplier way for us to  remember the historical correlation matrix (say, 60x60).  Let me know if I can offer further help.  Zimin          Brad Horn                02/15/2000 07:15 AM  To: Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Sandra Henderson/HOU/ECT@ect  Subject: Storage Model: Simple Issues  Zimin:  Thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation.  Your right to  point out the similarity to market bids.  Here are some basic questions tied  to implementation and calibration:  Model Infrastructure/IT Support: I obviously need to re-build my link to the  forward curves as the model is not working in my new location.  Short-term  (aprox 1 month), Id like to establish a link to the ENA database EGSPROD32  in order to fetch the long-dated price and volatility curves.  My link to ENA  forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated  by the new Bridgeline entity (database name and data structure yet to be  defined).  However, its not clear to me what is required in this two stage  process to support your model.  Any definition of model input or minimum  support requirements you provide is appreciated.  Ill then work with Sandra  Henderson, an Enron employee providing our IT support, to ensure the model  continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take  place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases.   Meanwhile, is there anything you think you can do to ensure Im up and running  quickly?  SANDRA: linking EXCEL spreadsheets to Bridgeline forward curves will be key  to all our pricing projects, not just the storage model supplied by Research.  Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Value: it would be helpful to decompose the models  calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic (time or  option) value.  I could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model  inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value,  and then through a simple  difference I could  determine the extrinsic value.  Ive included a simple  spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review.  I wanted to  share this with you to ask the following: does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently  than the simple difference proposed? do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the  backcode C-code via .dll in order to ensure run-time is faster?    My goal here is straightforward: a) to better understand the model and its  sensitivities.; and b) to determine if and when the option approach is  associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of  the time spreads.    Factor Loadings: What are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with  regards to factor loadings and how I should interpret the graph of the 3  factors calculated?  Factor loadings have always been a mystery to me.  For  example, what problems should I be looking for as a warning against  mispricing?  What, if anything, is implied about 1 day price change or  expected curve re-shapings (after all, curve-reshapings are key to storage  valuation!!!)?  Calibration: we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics  which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs.  Ill share the  data when we are and model results once Im up and running.

__label__DontSave	Market Forecasting Conference Hi Vince,  It been awhile since we have spoken, hope all has been going great for you.  I left a voice message on this conference subject with you.  We want to invite you to speak at our conference.  Thought you might like to take a look at the preliminary agenda so I am attaching that to this email.  This is the fourth year of our conference.  It has grown in quality and attendance each year.  The conference is held at Skamania lodge, which is about 45 minutes from the Portland airport.  Basically, we expect an attendance of about 70-80 individuals from the US and Canada.  We get a broad spectrum of attendance both geographically and functionally.  It is an excellent opportunity for networking and building knowledge about electric markets.  All of the presentations are very well attended.  We strive also for a broad spectrum of high quality speakers.  Many have no relation with EPIS, we simply are looking for the best speakers we can find.  We have a high respect for you and know that you would greatly add to the value of our conference.  It has always been a pleasure to work with you in the past.  For this conference, we would consult with you to develop a speaking topic that would fit with your desires and with our program.  As a speaker, your conference fees would be handled by us.  And the conference fees include all meals except one dinner.  You would handle the travel and hotel.  We also provide some opportunity for relaxation with a catered reception/dinner at the Columbia Gorge Interpretive Center, which overlooks the gorge and is filled with great history and information about the spectacular gorge, and on the second evening an informal/fun golf tournament (included in the conference fees) for those who are interested.  We hope that you would give this your consideration, and we look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks  Warren   Warren H.

__label__Save	Thomas Knudsen Hi Vince  I met with Thomas this morning (I gave you his CV before, though I dont know  if you had time to read it).  Hes extremely interested in moving to Enron,  and accepts that our work is far less academic than his postdoc research,  although far broader than his investment banking quant experience.  He  remains interested, and emphasised he wants to stay close to the traders, but  wants to look at new markets and products.  I think we should seriously  consider hiring him.  He is (understandably) reluctant to move to Houston,  but theres no doubt that there is plenty of (unnmet) demand for derivatives  pricing (and thinking) here in London.  Would you be interested in my setting up a videoconference in the next couple  of weeks so you have a chance to chat with him?  Im meeting with him again  on Tuesday at an academic quant finance seminar organised by Lane at Kings  College.  Ive attached his CV for your reference.

The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.    Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas residential customers within the four municipalities.

Enron in the Middle East  Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar. Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.  Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub.   Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

__label__Save	EOL Project Vince,  Just to update you on how things are going with regard to EOL -  I had a meeting with John Arnold yesterday to show him what had been  accomplished to date, and I think that he was fairly impressed by the  information available. I asked him for his input, and he expressed his  interest in having a couple of reports made up that couldnt be created from  the format the data was in. I spoke to Clayton about this, and he has already  made changes that will reflect a number of the modifications John requested.  I am also continuing to research the issue of an automated trading platform  for EOL. I have some information about how the NASDAQ operates, and I have  looked at some websites for ECNs, such as Archipelago, Island and Instinet. I  have also had a look at the International Securities Exchange (ISE) web-site,  but they do not seem to explain much about their system. Any further  suggestions would be appreciated.  I want to find out more about where EOL is currently and what modifications  may be necessary in the existing system, finish reading the material at the  websites I have investigated, and then I will try to put together a  presentation for you and/or Greg Whalley.

Please tell me whether you can justify sharing the cost and if so, the RC  code & co# for me to allocate your cost share.  Please indicate your choice  of the three cost choices.  Attached note below clarifies Potens proposal on the $10,000/yr subscription. Essentially we have three choices: 1.  for $2700/yr, the standard edition (11 issues, excluding the monthly  special feature article) 2.  for $3800/yr the premium edition, (standard edition PLUS the monthly  special feature article, as in three attached examples) 3. for $10,000/yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for  36 months.  Poten explains that 85% of their subscribers take the premium service.  No  one has ever asked for the $10,000/yr long-term price forecast.  I have an  interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to  others in the corporation. The example copies attached include the following Special Feature articles: 99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean 99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere 99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile One either takes all or none of them for the incremental $1100/yr.  Some may  be useless, others perhaps quite valuable.

As discussed, Poten is pleased to offer Enron the following two-part fuel-oil related service:  (1) a one-year subscription to Potens Fuel Oil in World Markets (Premium Edition), and  (2) a forecast of delivered crude prices and fuel oil prices in Northwest Europe (Brent and 1%S FOB fuel oil), the Mediterranean (Bonny Light and 1%S FOB fuel oil), and Singapore (Dubai and HSFO-380 cSt).  The forecasts would be provided four times a year and provide average quarterly price projections over the forward 36-month period. The forecast prices would be accompanied by brief textual commentary.  The forecasts would be issued over the course of the one-year Fuel Oil in World Markets subscription period.  The fee for the two-part service is US$10,000, payable in two equal installments  I look forward to hearing from you.  Best regards,  Larry  L.

Attached below are 3 example copies that include their standard 12 month  price forecasts.  The cost is $3800/yr. As an added service for a total of $10,000/yr, Poten will include a quarterly  update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and FO prices with a brief  justification for their view.  This would include the standard monthly price  forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24  months for Far East, Med and NWE.  (I expect a more descriptive email from  Poten, but I think this is the essence of their custom offer.)  The example copies attached include the following Special Features: 99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean 99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere 99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile These type of features are produced monthly and run a spectrum of subjects  related to fuel oil.  I have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the price  forecast without the considered recommendation of colleagues such as yourself  regarding the utility of such a report.  The best way to show your  recommendation is with money.  If it is not worth any money to anyone else in  ENE, then I have to question its validity and utility to me as well.

But does this signal a fundamental shift in the business environment for the refining industry? Probably not, since the margin strength of this year has been the result of the declining inventories and steeply backwardated futures prices that have been a feature of crude oil and refined products markets through most of 1999 and 2000. Global refining capacity continues to outpace demand with notable additions to effective capacity in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa in store for 2001. As a result, CERAs outlook is for moderating refining margins as the year progresses.  **end**  Follow URL for PDF version of Full Report.  ********************************************************* Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek2001, Shooting the Rapids:  Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future in Houston, February 12-16,  2001!

__label__Save	Introduction Mark, Mike,  I have scheduled a video conference with this gentleman on Thursday this week  at 3:30 p.m.  Can you join me for this conversation?  Vince   ---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 06/20/2000  04:16 PM ---------------------------   <avi.hauser@effem.com> on 06/20/2000 03:12:53 PM To: Vince J Kaminski <Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com> cc: richard.larsen@effem.com  Subject: Introduction   Vince:     As way of introduction, I wanted to write a bit about Mars inc. and then about CDS, the unit I head.  Mars is a private company, considered to be the largest privately owned manufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing  its finances, so the best I could do is refer to Forbes estimate of $15 Billion annual revenue and to the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in the business of manufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R)) food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and other products.  Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that emphasizes the long term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-win solutions with its suppliers, customers and partners.  As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of its expenses goes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history of researching those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand (people eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).  CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been very successful, with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage in these arenas. CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports  the purchasing function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is a multidiscipline and multinational team with a lot to offer.  Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile based on manufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in  this area. Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to talk to.  In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing to anything at this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to pursue the opportunity we discussed in the future.  I am looking forward to our video conference call.  Kind regards,  Avi    --------------------------------------- Avi I.

__label__Save	Clean Fuels - GPG business segment Dwight and I are working to develop an updated valuation for the MTBE and  methanol business segments.  We would appreciate assistance from your group  in assessing the market over the next 3-4 years.    With the octane shortage this summer, and the strong gas and oil price  environment, MTBE prices are well above budgeted levels.  How will  political/environmental issues affect MTBE prices over the next few years.    Methanol prices are also now very favorable, but it would seem that North  American methanol producers will be disadvantaged if gas prices in NA remain  higher than the rest of the world.  Your thoughts on these and any other factors affecting prices would be most  helpful.  Both Dwight and I are available to meet with you or a member of  your group as soon as convenient.

__label__Save	Re: weather course Julie,  Enron location makes more sense. No reason to pay for the hotel. Also, I think that one day makes more sense.  I contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training course. I think that they would be interested if they got a good discount.

VinceJKaminski <Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com> cc: Subject:?  weather course    Vince,  We just wanted to let you know  that we only have 3 people signed up for the weather derivatives course  (all from Enron) so far. We have a couple more that have expressed strong  interest, but we are awaiting their final decision. If no one else signs  up, Chris and Les thought that you guys could probably get through the  first day pretty easily, and thus thought it may be an option to teach just  the 2nd day material (pricing) only at Enron (doing it at the Hyatt is an  option as well but the room might be on the large? side)? We would  obviously reimburse you for the day not taught. We can teach both days as  well, but thought you may want to save some time.  I just wanted to give  you some time to think about it. We will know? where we stand on final  numbers by next  Wednesday.

__label__Save	retail markets conference I would like to invite you to participate in a conference on Retail Participation in Competitive Power Markets to be held at Stanford University on June 21-22, 2001. Although California and other regional markets will likely be introducing some demand-response programs by June, there is a clear need for continual evaluation of these nascent efforts to transform the market. The conference provides an opportunity to learn from different experiences.  This policy research meeting will focus on establishing a foundation for understanding the key concepts and methods for demand response programs and to provide an opportunity for participants to raise questions and recommend directions for additional research and analysis.  Participants will come from companies, government, and universities.  You can obtain more information about the conference by checking under Meetings on our EMF website listed below.  Please let me know if you plan on attending.  Also, if you would like to make a brief 15-minute presentation, please let me know your topic and describe it in a few sentences.  I will try to choose speakers that will cover the full range of interests represented by this group.  Researchers should focus on the implications of their analysis for designing demand response programs rather than on the technical details of their methodology.  I would also encourage practitioners to discuss their experience in implementing demand response programs or in raising selected issues.

__label__Save	Naphtha hedge for 2001 Folks,  I am forwarding this in order for the team to focus on the naphtha issue.   Please note that:  As Phase II comes on line, Blocks B and C will first have to run on naphtha  for a period of 3-6 months This will hit us some time in 2001, hence is a more urgent issue than LNG,  which is still a year away If there are delays in the commissioning of the Regas terminal, the period on  naphtha could further prolong The naphtha market is more volatile than the crude market, and is not as  deep, hence we need to take small positions early on to test the market DPC Board has already approved a Risk Management Policy that allows for  hedging.  We may need to look into options that are costless (selling put and  buying call) to begin with, and test while only Block A is in place. Close coordination will be required on this with the Global Markets group,  and I propose someone like Anshuman should actually be seconded onto the group A whole plan on tools to manage the fuel risk need to be worked in close  coordination with the team on the ground  These are just some of my thoughts.  With 50% of the tariff being fuel price  dependent, this is an area that requires close attention.

Per our discussion, Ive enclosed three files that include an invitation, agenda and rsvp form for the June 10 symposium on High Tech Acquisitions at Insead.  If you or the individual(s) who will be attending have any questions, please email:  Phanish Puranam at: PHANIS20@WHARTON.UPENN.EDU or you can call him at 215-898-1231.  This initiative will be expanded during the coming year and I believe that Enrons involvement will give the company access to some of the early research in progress as it unfolds, and of course, if you become involved as a partner in the Emerging Technologies Program you would have opportunities to help guide the direction of the research which is one of the partnership benefits.  Our next upcoming events are scheduled for:  Friday, September 8 WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET? This is a faculty update day with industry partners also invited. We will co-sponsor this with Whartons major e-Business initiative. Major issues addresses include New Economics of the Web and Internet, Anywhere.  Friday, October 20 FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE, SHAKEOUTS & SURVIVAL STRATEGIES Designed by the ET core group and presented in collaboration with the e-Commerce Forum.

To assist in your decision, we recommend having a representative attend the symposium in Paris on June 10 to test drive the program.  Ill send you a formal invitation which you are free to accept at your convenience, should you agree that Enrons participation in the ET Program would be of value.

Over the last four to five months, requests for our support have gone up, primarily for consumption risk, physical options and value-at-risk.   However, given the challenges we are facing now, I would like to reduce the Research staff for EAM to a core team of 3 people with a budget allocation of roughly $750,000. Please note that this includes not only the salaries and bonuses, but also the overhead and other expenses as well. The breakdown of the support levels for individual groups (with agreement from the group heads) is as follows:  EAM Fundamentals (Steve Meyers) 0.4 FTE   Curve and Model Development Group (Mauricio Quintana)   Project Valuation Group (Steve Kromer) DSM Desk 0.6 FTE   Pricing and Risk Premiums (Ravi Duggirala) DSM VAR and risk controls (Vladi Gorny) 0.5 FTE Consumption/SiteProfile Desk (Mallik AVS) 1.25FTE   Consumption Premium Models    Support for SiteProfile Issues (load shaping, asset profiling, etc.)  Other Short Term Requests 0.25FTE  (Examples from last year: Insurance Model for Rick Jones, Business Assurance data analysis, etc.)  I would really appreciate if both of you can approve or provide your feedback on this.

__label__Save	Market Maker simulation V.2 Stinson and Vince,  I finished the second version of the model which deals with Open to Close  trading. The major difference is that there is an additional mark to market at Open  price which will affect the P/L.  I also added the output features that John wants to see.  The cumulative P/L is path dependent, the Net Open Allowed seemingly has a strong influence on the cumulative P/L trajectory.

__label__Save	Re: digitals Pavel, Many thanks for your note.  I understand that Digitals are not core Enron business but as you know, Im  trying to explore Digitals to give, for example, a company a guaranteed  income in year one (to mop up expiring tax losses). This  is offset by a  guaranteed expense in year two. See attached hypothetical example. The  digital will reflect an underlying commodity to which a company is exposed to  and would be part of a price risk management strategy, thereby giving it  commercial purpose.   I would be interested in hearing from you generally on the subject --  the  rational for using Digitals and  your knowledge of its use in other markets  (electricity or other commoodity or in the banking sector).  It seems to me that setting the srike is key and a value judgement or am I  wrong, and are there curves and models which could help you substantiate  this? In any event, do you have a feel for what an acceptable % of chance or  likelihood that a commodity price hits the strike on a digital before it  becomes non arms length and does not pass the smell test?  Vince, Jarek suggested that you may be able to assist. Your views would also  be appreciated.  Gillian.      From: Pavel Zadorozhny on 02/11/2000 15:15 CST To: Gillian Lockwood/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: digitals  Digital options are extremely uncommon in the crude oil market. Nobody ever  asked me to show quotes in the OTC market. The only time we encountered them  was when producers, brought by our marketing team, wanted to sell a  knock-outable swap, whereby they would get a higher swap price in exchange  for cancelling the swap if the price settled below a certain level. This  structure had a digital put embedded in it, although the customers didnt  necessarilly know that. The companies were US oil and gas producers: Venoco,  Titan, Magnum Hunter, Patiena Oil & Gas, Belco, Central Resources. It was  about 1 year ago. In the OTC market, at about the same time, I asked for  quotes to hedge these transactions and sold a digital Cal 00 $16 swaption to  Elf and strips of digital puts to somebody else that I cannot recall.  I hope this helps.

__label__DontSave	Re: VAR for Niamh portfolio Financial Products Niamh,  I examined how VAR of Financial Products portfolio depends on  term-structure of correlations between BRENT and 61NY. Here are the results  (for positions on 11/6/00):  1). If we assume correlations of 1 across all forward contacts for Brent and  61NY as well as between Brent and 61NY for all maturities,  VAR=$424,199  2). If we calculate correlations based on first 18 contracts prices for both  Brent and 61NY together and assume longer maturity contracts are all perfectly correlated,  then  VAR=$1,868,949  3). Same as (2) but correlations are based on 12 first contracts, everything  beyond that is perfectly correlated, then:  VAR=$1,106,773.  Conclusion 1:  when we use higher correlations, VAR goes down (as we  expected). Conclusion 2: correlations depend on how many forward contracts we use to  calculate them. We should use all liquidly traded contracts, because prices  for those contain statistically reliable information.  I chose 18 initially, what is your suggestion?  Regards,  Tanya.

__label__Save	My model for spikes Dear Dr. Kaminski,  I was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis the first of the preprints that I recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power. In this regard, I have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research and the Institute for Computational Finance at the UT Austin. Right now I am also in the process of forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be interested in receiving this preprint. Please let me know if you might be interested in receiving this preprint.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Sincerely yours,  Valery Kholodnyi Manager of Quantitative Analysis Research and Analytics Group TXU Energy Trading  PS. Here are the main preprints that I have recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power:  1. Valery A. Kholodnyi, The Stochastic Process for Power Prices with Spikes  and Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power, Preprint, TXU-RAG-01/00,  July 2000. 2. Valery A. Khlolodnyi, Valuation of a Swing Option on Power with Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-05/00, August, 2000. 3. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Spark Spread Option on Power with  Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-21/00, November 2000. 4. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power at  Two Distinct Points on the Grid with Spikes in Both Power Prices, Preprint TXU-RAG-24/00, November 2000. 5. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Transmission Option on Power with  Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-25/00, November 2000.  As I have indicated to you in my previous e-mail, contrary to the standard approaches, I model spikes directly, as self-reversing jumps on top of a stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of spikes. In this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non-Markovian process, even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is Markovian. Among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes, provided that the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the absence of spikes.

Mohan - Last when we spoke (Friday), you were going to explore the tax  aspects of having DPC be the signing company.  Please tell us if that works.  Separately, you and Wade may need to consider how DPC lenders may look upon  some of the information emerging from this study, and whether you want all of  it in lender domain.  Based on the same you may want to decide whether this needs to be EIPL, ENE  Houston, or DPC.  We could also have a version where ENE Houston is signing  the contract on behalf of DPC.  Please let me know what you decide, and we will proceed accordingly.  If you  would like someone in EIPL/DPC to be signing the contract, please let me  know, who the signing authority is.

Meeting with Mark Braemer (??) to discuss subjective inputs to your credit models (to be released this summer).   2.  Your willingness to let us use some of your data (in files on the 6th floor) to experiment with Moodys RiskCalc.   In the near future I would love to meet with Mark and some of the model developers to learn more about their modeling process - especially the subjective component.  Please let me know how I can contact Mark and any relevant parties.   Also, thank you in advance for allowing Kyriakos access to your files on the 6th floor.  We will contact you on Tuesday morning to find out when it is convenient for him to come down.     More specifically, to evaluate Moodys RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enrons North American (private firm) counterparties:        Fiscal Year The prior twelve months of financial data are represented. Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables, such as cost of goods sold, net income, sales, and EBIT. The value should be a four-digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000. Forecasts until the year 2009 can be made. A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last years (1999) inflation level. In general this estimation error will not cause any great problems, as size affects default rates at very large scales (e.g., $10,000,000 vs. $1,000,000 makes a significant difference, $1,000,000 vs. $1,050,00 does not).   Cash & Equivalents This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities.   Inventory Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet, in thousands dollars, without any alterations for accounting method (e.g., LIFO, FIFO, Average Cost). This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue. Specifically this would include purchase cost, sales cost, sales taxes, transportation costs, insurance costs, and storage costs.  Current Assets This item primarily represents cash, inventories, accounts receivables, marketable securities, and other current assets.   Total Assets Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars. For example, $15,500,000 should be entered as 15500. Specifically, total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property, plant, and equipment plus other noncurrent assets (including intangible assets, deferred items, and investments and advances). Leave previous years total assets blank for Australian companies.   Current Liabilities Liabilities are positive values. Included in current liabilities are short-term debt, accounts payable, and other current liabilities.    Total Liabilities This balance sheet account, total liabilities, is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long-term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities (including deferred taxes, investment tax credit, and minority interest).    Retained Earnings Retained Earnings, a historical measure of performance, is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders. Typically, it is the prior years retained earnings plus net income less distributions. Retained earnings are generally positive. Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings. Leave this field blank for Australian companies.   Sales This item consists of the industry segments gross sales (the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period) reduced by cash discounts, trade discounts, and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers.   Cost of Goods Sold Entered in thousands of dollars, this value is generally a positive number less than sales. It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production, such as material, labor, and overhead. Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Leave this field blank for Australian companies.   EBIT Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation. It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income.   Interest Expense This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short- and long-term debt. Typically, we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities. One measure of computing this is: Interest Expense = 0.07 * total liabilities.    Net Income This item represents the income (or loss) reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations. A loss is represented by a negative sign. For example, a $5,000,000 loss would be entered as -5000. Leave previous years net income blank for Australian companies.     Extraordinary Items Positive or negative, this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement. The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations. These items include extraordinary gains/losses, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and cumulative affect of accounting changes. Expenses are entered as negative values, gains as positive values. Leave previous years extraordinary items blank for Australian companies.    Country This model is calibrated for the United States, Canada, and Australia.

__label__Save	 Greg, FYI - Jeff asked me to forward this to you for your review.  SRS ---------------------- Forwarded by Sherri Sera/Corp/Enron on 05/15/2000  04:25 PM ---------------------------   Joseph A. Cherian <cherian@bu.edu> on 05/09/2000 08:10:19 AM To: Jeffrey K. Skilling <sreinar@enron.com> cc: Vince J Kaminski <vkamins@ect.enron.com>, Robert A. Jarrow  <raj15@cornell.edu>, Robert C. Merton <rmerton@hbs.edu>   Subject:    Mr. Jeffrey K. Skilling President and C.O.O., Enron Corp.  Dear Jeff,  This email is from Robert Jarrow (Cornell) and myself (Joe Cherian). I hope you recall meeting/lunching with Bob Jarrow & me when you keynoted at my 1999 Math Finance Day conference here at Boston University. I wanted to introduce you to SKG Inc., a startup that is focused on providing an innovative service to the electronic trading community. Messers Kuppuswamy Seshadhri, Sriketan Mahanti, and Gaurav Mallik are the principal founders of SKG, Inc. Bob Jarrow and I represent the companys Scientific Advisory Board. Nobel laureate Robert Merton, who also sat on our table during your keynote address, very kindly serves as an ad hoc Senior Advisor to SKG and has been an invaluable resource to SKG, including putting us in touch with JP Morgan. Coincidentally, the C.O.O. of JP Morgan Capital Corp. Ed Colloton, in an April 7 meeting told us he would introduce us to the C.F.O. of Enron Online, whom he knows and at which he felt SKG would have huge value-adding opportunities. However, given Eds busy travel schedule, I dont believe he has been able to do that yet. Hence this joint decision by Bob Jarrow and myself to send you this email.  SKGs solution is to provide dynamic pricing and value maximization in electronic trading of securities/commodities on ECNs and ATSs (Alternative Trading Systems). It achieves this through a process of strategic negotiation using automated agents (intelligent software manifestations). Our system should not be viewed as an ECN, but rather as an enhancement to any extant trading system, be it an ECN, ATS, CLOB, NASDAQ, etc. Our initial system design has been conducted for financial instruments trading, e.g. bonds/equities, but our strategy is as much applicable to energy/power instruments trading, high speed communications bandwidth trading, and other web-based commodities trading, which we believe is of interest to Enron Online.  SKG is superior to existing solutions in the following way: 1)  It considers multiple attributes, e.g., price, time, volatility, bandwidth. (In high speed communication bandwidth scenarios, for example, the dimensions could be price, bandwidth size, time for which bandwidth available, continguity of the allocation, and such.) 2) It involves dynamic matching as opposed to static matching. 3) It is multi-lateral. 4)  It adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions. 5) It allows traders to make important trade-offs, as they do in traditional markets.  Currently, SKG is involved in discussions with the Heads of Trading at Fidelity, Putnam Investments, Lehman Bros., KPMG, Meridien Research, Salomon Smith Barney, JP Morgan, State Street, Banc of America, McKinsey, Citizens Power, and a host of other folks.  We think we have a value-adding service to provide to Enron Online or any other Enron subsidiary that the SKG offering matches and that you deem fit. SKGs founders and I will be very happy to provide you or your representative(s) with more details, including a demo of the prototype, in a meeting. We are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange something appropriate.  Thanks very much, Jeff! We look forward to hearing from you.  With warm regards, Joseph Cherian and Robert Jarrow  Cc: Professor Robert C. Merton  Joseph A.

__label__DontSave	Re: Risk Profile and Liability Mitigation Product Cheryl -   Please include me in follow up meeting.  Thanks,  Jeff        Enron Energy Services  From:  Richard L Zdunkewicz                           05/03/2001 09:56 AM       To: James L Bouillion/Enron@EnronXGate, Paul Clayton/Enron@EnronXGate, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: James Harris/HOU/EES@EES, Jeff Forbis/HOU/EES@EES, Richard B Jones/HOU/EES@EES, Cheryl Brashier/HOU/EES@EES  Subject: Risk Profile and Liability Mitigation Product  Please find attached a Scope of Services document and a list of projects which have been implemented with current EES customers.  The Scope of Services document is designed to show the types of projects, operations and maintenance, and facilities management services that EESO typically offers to its customers based on their industry segment.  The projects and services offered are very similar across segments and customers, but their level of deployment varies significantly from segment to segment.    Certain segments were grouped together because the EESO offering would feature similar assets and services. SIC Codes were given for each segment to represent the types of customers that comprise each segment.  The list of projects represents general categories from which more specific projects will be tailored to fit the clients needs.  This project list represents assets that have been approved by the DSM Desk and was queried from PCCS. The Operations and Maintenance services can be applied to any energy-related assets and was compiled from term sheets and IAM.  Generally those activities have been limited to a few industrial outsourcing deals including Springs, Polaroid and recently Eli Lilly. Facilities Management is usually outsourced via IPT or through the adoption of existing vendor contracts and can involve repair and maintenance for all assets.   Generally this type of activity has been focused on the retail/real estate segment.        Cheryl, pls set up a meeting with Harris, Clayton, Bouillion, Jones and Kaminski to discuss this and an action plan to develop a liability mitigation product.  I will re-present the original product concept at the meeting.  Would like to see the meeting take place late next week.  Thanks.

__label__Save	PSerc Denver Meeting Vince, The PSerc meeting Lance and I went to was both interesting and boring. PSerc has 11 school members  and 30 industry members. Its Research Program consists of three stems:  Markets, Transmission and Distribution, and Systems. (Enrons interests probably lie mainly in the first stem.)   In morning of the first day, researchers from universities presented their project proposals. I found some of them  quite interesting. For example, Shmuel Oren, Fernando Alvarado, Tim Mount (of Cornell) propose to study Market Redesign: Incorporating the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market design,  Shijie Deng, S. Oren et al propose to study  Power asset valuation model in a market-based and reliability-constrained electric power system. The first got funded but the second did not.   In the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their own discussion. I went to the academic discussion and Lance the industry one.  I hope my presence there did not make things worse, for the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion.  The proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants.   The proposal process goes as follows: researchers first write a short  proposal to appropriate stem committee (no industry participantion, it seems  to me), each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4. The  selected proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry.  Industry then gets to vote which proposals get funded.  However, some researchers were very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process. There were accusation of self-ranking, communication between stem committee and member schools breaking down, and so on. Some were even asking for  some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before  wrting it  (the arguement was Then it was a waste of our time to write proposals,  which I found quite amusing).   All in all, I found the process was not taken seriously enough by university  researchers. PSerc has been established for 5 years now and it still does  not have a proper proposal screen process, which is hard to believe. Also,  the communication among university researchers, between stem committee  and member schools, and most importantly, between researchers and industry,  are not  smooth as all.  Since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members, the right projects may not get funded. Too many participants also make the decision process very indecisive and quite painful to watch (Lance can comment on this better).  They also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which made the voting a less authoritive.  I believe Enron will not get much returns from join PSerc (price tag is  $40,000 per company per year).  If we find some projects interesting, we can sponsor the schools in the form of summer interns, the schools claim that most of the  fund goes to support students anyway.

At the end of the session, I was hoping to talk to you, but unfortunately you were already gone. You said that if we were interested, you could e-mail a copy of your talk. I would appreciate if you could send a copy to this e-mail address.   I am a mathematics Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University and I will be graduating this August. I am very much interested in working in the modeling of energy markets. Can you please tell me whom I should send my resume, and who I should contact in your company about a possible position in your research group.   Thank you for your time.   Sincerely   G.

__label__DontSave	Energy Institute Curriculum Dear Vince,   We have been working on the curriculum for some of the educational programs to be offered by the Energy Markets Institute that Arthur Warga and I discussed with you in the summer.  I am attaching (tentative) curricula for two important programs: (1) A graduate certificate in Energy Finance, (2) A 5-year BBA/MS program in Energy Finance.  Briefly, the certificate is a 5-course for-credit program that is available to people with sufficient basic background in finance, economics, statistics and mathematics.  This certificate includes coursework in accounting issues specific to the energy industry, basic aspects of energy sources and the organization and regulation of energy industry, forecasting and time-series econometric methodologies, basics of financial engineering and derivatives, real-options and project analysis as it applies to the energy industry, and energy derivatives and risk-managament.  The 5-year program is more ambitious. It seeks to provide a broad but rigorous curriculum for future energy industry professionals and managers. In the undergraduate component students take rigorous courses in math, probability and statistics, economics, chemistry and physics, and accounting and finance. This is conceived to be an elite and highly demanding program where students have to handle the more demanding courses in a variety of areas.  The 5th or graduate year of the program is given over to the energy certificate and additional graduate courses in finance and accounting.  I know you are extremely busy, but it would be very helpful to get your reaction (even at a broad level) to these programs and the type of courses that are envisaged.  We view these programs to potentially form the core of the educational activities of the Institute, but the next step would be to develop more specialized programs (of shorter duration) aimed at professionals already working on challenging problems in the industry.

__label__DontSave	opportunities in Enron Hi, Vince,  This is Slav Fain - Oracle DBA  and I hope you remember me. Weve met at the infosession in Berkley and have talked about Houston, rotation program or other possible openings Enron might have.  Today Ive saw an add for the Junior DBA position in Houston and I was wondering  if it might be in your company. I beleive I told you, that Im pretty open for different position. I was doing a lot of development projects in Berkley and enjoyed it. Ive also found DBA work also very challenging and rewarding. I would be very intersted in joining the rotation program to see different possibilities and aspects of IT department.  Im opening for relocation and I think with knowledge, experience and my enthusiasm to learn and ability to work under tight timeline - I think I can be a good match for Enron.  Hope to hear from you soon.  Slav  __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Make a great connection at Yahoo!

Peter is looking currently for a job.  I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics society at the University of Houston.  The application of recent developments in optimization theory and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further  efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel.

__label__DontSave	Re: Default rates Mark, this is a good point.  In Moodys June 1999 study, Debt Recoveries for  Corporate Bankruptcies, there is a graph of Firm-Level Recovery Rates by Year  of Bankruptcy Resolution (as opposed to default year).   Reading from the  graph finds:      As the data above is based on resolution year, the same study finds the  average length of time spent in bankruptcy is 1.30 years (median 1.15 years  and standard deviation of 1.20 years).  The interesting point is the slide in  recovery value 1996 to 1998.   One would wonder if the mix of high-yield  issuance slanted towards the tech companies would yield lower recoveries  (quick technological obsolescence--little tangible recovery value).    Interesting to note is the December 1999 to December 2000 change in spreads.   The table below divides the December 2000 spreads by the December 1999  spreads.   One would have expected a pronounced flight to safety over this  time-frame, but the figures are more mixed:          To: Michael Tribolet/Corp/Enron@ENRON, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, David  Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: Re: Default rates    Per our discussion, see attached for impact of assumed recovery rates:      Michael Tribolet@ENRON 12/11/2000 08:09 AM To: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J  Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Ruane/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Default rates   Please see below for my note to Jeremy at the bottom and his reponse.

__label__Save	calculating bid-ask prices This is about Enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for  trading future of a movies gross box office receipt. Rich sent to many  people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide  some feedback.  I think the idea (see below) might be applicable to other parts of Enron. We  can call it Dynamic bid-ask price process. In fact, we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is  submitted to the system within a specified amount of time. The final  (clearing) bid and ask prices are just the last tentative price shown to  the public before the bidding period ends. (So the customers can see the  final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish.)  I think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via  EnronOnline.com. -Chonawee   ---------------------- Forwarded by Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron on  04/24/2001 07:48 PM ---------------------------   Chonawee Supatgiat 04/24/2001 07:40 PM To: Richard DiMichele/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Harkness/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Greg Wolfe/HOU/ECT@ECT, James  Ginty/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Jim Fallon/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Kelly Kimberly/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Kevin Howard/Enron Communications@Enron  Communications, Key Kasravi/Enron Communications@Enron Communications,  Kristin Albrecht/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kristina  Mordaunt/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Martin  Lin/Contractor/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Paul Racicot/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Zachary McCarroll/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Martin Lin/Contractor/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications   Subject: calculating bid-ask prices   I think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to  forecast it. Otherwise, if our forecast is not consistence with the market,  we may have an imbalance in the bid-ask orders and we may end up taking some  positions. You know, as Russ and Martin pointed out, we cannot fight with the  studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the  price easily.  One way to ensure the balance of the bid-ask orders is to embed an exchange  system inside our bid-ask prices front end. Each week, we have a trading  period. During the period, instead of posting bid-ask prices, we post  tentative bid-ask prices, then we ask our customers to submit their  acceptable buying or selling price. These tentative bid-ask prices get  updated and are shown to the public. Of course, customers can revise/withdraw  their bids anytime during the trading period. At the end of the period, we  calculate and post the final bid and ask prices. The seller who submits lower  selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price. The buyer  who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask  price. Next week, we repeat the same process.  This way, we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a  broker where we dont take any position at all. We make profit from those  bid-ask spread. We dont have to worry about forecasting accuracy and  insiders trading because we dont have to take any position. Let the market  be the one who decides the price.   If we maintain our net position as zero, at the end, when all the actual  gross box office numbers are reported in those publications, our customers  with open long/short positions are perfectly matched. Using the  mark-to-market charge can reduce credit risk.

I think that we, as a market maker, can  reduce our credit risk (risk of default) if we do the mark-to-market  charging. That is, each week when we release a new expected value of the  gross box office receipt, we balance all the opening positions the same way  as in a regular future market. This way, we can give margin calls to the  couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money. In the last paragraph, I think the gross box office can also be determined  from the market itself (i.e., if there are lots of buyers, our offer price  should go up.) We can offer other derivative products such as options as well. -Chonawee Chonawee Supatgiat chonawee.supatgiat@enron.com enron.com Stinson Gibner stinson.gibner@enron.com  Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com

The message he takes will  likely go directly to the PMO in Delhi.  I will therefore be working closely  to convey the right impression.  For N.K.Singh clearly there are three things you would try to convey: A description of the problem,  Some of the resultant consequences if it is not solved soon enough, and Conveying the fact that there are win-win solutions well within the GoIs  power to implement, that would in fact enhance his reputation and the  countrys as one that lives up to its reputation  I would be careful to make the point that we are NOT going to give up any  value, but are willing to be accomodative to MSEB, GoM, and GoI needs, either  through financial re-engineering, or through getting direct access to the  market in some areas.  This will also fly well with Enron management that is  more comfortable with market risks than political.  Describing the Problem  DPC has a PPA, backed by GoI & GoM guarantees for one of the most high  profile projects in the world  (Worlds largest gas fired power plant, Indias first LNG terminal, gateway  to providing clean reliable energy for all of western India, development of  Konkan) With coming of Phase II (due end-2001) cost of power from Dabhol will be more  competitive than any other liquid fuel fired plant  (low heat rates, larger turbines, spreading of infrastructure costs over a  larger base, use of LNG as fuel) (Our average tariff at 90% despatch is Rs. 4.02/kWh for Phase I.  This goes  down to Rs. 3.30 - 3.70/kWh with coming in of Phase II.  Compare this with  NTPCs own Kayamkulam plant having a tariff of Rs.3.32 - 4.01for same range  of crude prices ($21-28/barrel).  Hence DPC power is competitive, our  standards of performance are higher, penalties for non-performance are  greater, and as a private player, our place in the waterfall seems to be  lower (quote the fact that while we have been delayed in payment by 45-60  days, MSEB has made all of its other payment commitments). However, monthly outflows could be as much as Rs. 450 Cr./month; MSEBs  monthy collections not improving - are in the range of Rs. 900 Cr./month   MSEB, and GoM clearly do not have the resources, in the short run (3-5 yrs.)  to meet these obligations; hence Central intervention is needed. In a grid of 13000 MW (Maharashtra grid size), absorbing an additional 1440  MW (Phase II) at one go is difficult; however if we take Western Region, grid  size is 42000 MW.  Clearly absorbing all the power in that framework is much  easier.   To this if we add Northern and Southern grids, we can probably evacuate out  another 500-700 MW through the interconnects.  Hence, there is definitely  value in looking at this issue at a national level. Additionally, it is not just solvable at that level, but actually answers to  the crying need for power in the country, and hence is a boon for the govt.,  and should be treated as such.  Consequences of Not Solving the Problem We can call upon the sovereign guarantee, which will cover our partial  payments.  However, this would almost definitely lead to a deterioration of  the countrys credit rating - put back incoming investments into the  Petroleum sector (where private participation program is about to be unveiled  in 25 O&G blocks), telecom sector (where a new policy has been announced  months ago, and where foreign companies are looking favorably at investing). It is likely to put India on the backlist of many international banks,  including export credit agencies of US, Japan, and Belgium (an EEC member). It would bring to the knees many prominent Indian banks (Indian lenders to  the project include IDBI, ICICI, SBI, to metion just a few) Would completely stop any new investment into the power sector, where there  is urgent need for funding (especially te new initiatives in transmission) There is a timeline for solving this, since our project is coming before  year-end 2001, and hence we cannot wait for the slow pace of reform to take  place at the SEB and state level.   Win-Win Solutions Exist Northern region is power starved, south needs power badly.  Hence it is a  boon to have this power made available in the timeframe.  With Central govt.  intevention, it is possible to solve th problem to everyones mutual benefit. 1440 MW (incremental Phase II) is only 3.4% of the capacity existing in the  Western Region, and can be easily absorbed. Win-Win Solutions exist by: Restructuring some of the guarantees Adding some central govt entity (including those from the petroleum sector -  IOC or GAIL, interested due to LNG trml.) to the equity mix at par Back-ending tariff and other financial re-engineering solutions that could  involve Indian banks taking a greater share of the debt. et. etc.  Bottom Line:  Time is of essence; we need to get someone to negotiate with.  Please use  your good offices to quickly form a representative group that includes  Central, State govt., and SEB representatives so that we can work on the  solution. Without active participation from PMs office, we are likely to waste  precious time bouncing between the SEB, GoM, and various Ministries of GoI.  Hope this helps.  Regards, Sandeep.

In many cases the same point was made by more than one person.  The similar comments helped me decide what was important, but I selected just one version to include in the writing.  You may notice that I have edited your statements to reflect past tense and otherwise to improve the flow of the overall text.  My intention is not to change the meaning of what you said. Please look the quotes over and let me know if these words can be used as they are written as part of the writing or if you want to change anything.  In either case, please let me know by email or by phone ((713) 871-8345 before January 30th).    I have assembled a great description about your group using your collective words.  As of now, the sections include: Beginning Efforts  Maintaining Effectiveness in Client Services  Guiding Principles of the Operations  Leadership  Personal Characteristics and Interpersonal Dynamics  Reflective Thoughts at the End Once I have approval from each of the 20 people who provided quotes, I will send an edited draft to Vince for his comments.  After that, Ill send the document to you for your comments.  Then I will focus on publication, although in the end, I expect that the document will have to be further pared to have a chance of being published.   I still believe that the experience of the Research Group was extraordinary in itself.  At the same time, the current publicity related to the larger Enron debacle may override the Research Groups story for a while.   In case youre wondering, I have not attempted to relate the Research Group story to current Enron issues in any way.

__label__DontSave	RiskNews Update - 1/6/2001 ============================================================ RiskNews Update - week ending 1/6/2001 http://www.risknews.net News for derivatives and risk management professionals ============================================================  Dear Subscriber,  Welcome to RiskNews Update!  The top news of the week came as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision received widespread criticism from banks, trade associations and academics regarding its proposed implementation of Basel II, the new capital accord for internationally active banks.  The International Swaps and Derivatives Association criticised the proposed introduction of rigid capital floors. The leading swaps trade body also criticised the internal ratings multiplier and controversial w charge on credit derivatives, and was supported by the US Bond Markets Association (BMA). The BMA also said the proposals would increase regulatory capital costs, and impair liquidity in repo, securities lending and margin lending transactions. US investment bank Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, said it is concerned the accord could adversely affect banks that concentrate on trading activities rather than lending. Multilateral lending body, the IMF, called for the new proposals to be applied to all banks in all countries and not just internationally active institutions, while others raised grave concerns that the proposals would have a significant detrimental impact on loans to emerging markets.  RiskNews (www.risknews.net) has produced eight stories on the subject of Basel responses and will continue to investigate replies in the coming weeks.

__label__DontSave	FW: INFORMS Presentation About the INFORMS presentation, there were many people showing their interests, including Prof. Suvrajeet Sen from Arizona, Prof. Jussi Keppo from Michigan, and couple of students from U. of Pittsburgh, CMU, and U of Maryland. Prof. Sen invited me to meet his group there, Prof. Keppo wants to join effort in writing a paper, and a CMU student offer to join work for his Ph.D. requirement. (See their e-mails below).  Those opportunities sound interesting. I think it will be good for the company too because we will have additional people working on the problems that will benefit us. If you have any research problems that you want me to work on please let me know then.  On the other hand, I will not give away our secret. I will consult with you first if I am not sure how secret it is.  Thank you, -Chonawee  FYI: Three weeks ago, my previous lawyer Lisa Ried told me that she transferred my greencard case to another Lawyer Kristen Burke. So now she is handling my case. She will file the petition this week.   -----Original Message----- From: Suvrajeet Sen [mailto:sen@sie.arizona.edu] Sent: Sunday, November 11, 2001 10:33 PM To: Supatgiat, Chonawee Cc: Suvrajeet Sen Subject: INFORMS Presentation   Hi,  I attended your talk at the INFORMS meeting, and found that your goals (valuing long term contracts) have a lot in common with goals of our research.

__label__Save	Re: Summer visits Steve,  I can pick up the cost of your trip from the Research Group budget.  The more I think about  it, the more I am convinced it would be difficult  to justify 2 trips per person. I think that we should go for one contiguous  stay per person and make a good effort to make these trips productive.  Vince      Steven Leppard 05/11/2000 03:41 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Dale Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Summer visits    Vince  Thanks for offering to look my presentation over.  The deadline for  submission has been extended until tomorrow (Friday), so theres less of a  hurry.  As regard our summer visits, well need to speak to Dale over the budget.   Personal commitments mean its difficult for me to take two whole months to  visit, so if the cost is prohibitive I may need to make just one shorter  visit.  Id obviously like to spend longer, and two visits seems to be the  only way I can do it.  I believe the situation is similar for Kirstee.  Ive persuaded Richard to pay for Matts visit in its entirety, and Ive no  doubt that RAC/Credit Trading will pick up the bills for Ben and Kirstee.   Its difficult to think whod be the natural group to pay for me.  I honestly  think Ill have difficulty persuading, e.g. Richard, that its worth his  while to pay for my visit.  I get the impression he thinks Im doing OK  without the need to go to Houston for further training.  Im interviewing a candidate for Bjorns model review role during todays  videoconference, so well need to speak beforehand or perhaps Friday.  All the best, Steve     Vince J Kaminski 05/10/2000 01:54 PM To: Steven Leppard/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Grant  Masson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Pinnamaneni Krishnarao/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Conference  Steve,  I am tied up at the Power2000 conference.

So here is an outline of the R&R and required technology to support the administration of factor loadings:     << File: FactorLoadingProcess.doc >>   Broadly, I have assumed that Global Risk Ops can run the process. However, exceptions can take one of two forms:  Large jumps in VaR due to bona fide changes in correlations; Pathologies in the matrix construct supporting factors;  For either, tools are required for users to examine the exceptions and make changes as necessary (generally Global ops in the former case and RAC/Research in the latter).  Note that the IT Development group has no part in this business process beyond building the tools.  Lets use this as the starting point to develop a business model that makes this work.

__label__Save	Petrochem Desk I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to  curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in  April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at  construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or  SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of  the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked  about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that theyd only been  around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John  Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.     From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at  least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to  understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday  during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX  component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could  then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors  (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

I apologize for the response delay.  Ive gone back through  the analysis that I did back in April, and have thrown around some ideas with  Vince and Stinson.  The issue may be summarized as follows.   The hedge relationship was derived using JCC and prompt Brent, and is valid  for JCC and prompt Brent.  No problems here.  However, it will not be valid  for points far out on the forward curve.  Intuitively, this hedge  relationship will approach one as we move far out on the curve, but since  there is no data, I can not statistically determine this.  One can imagine a  term structure of heding ratios that start at 0.67 and move to 1.0, so that  the back end of the curves would move together, but how fast it converges to  one is anyones guess.   If there is a way of determining the historical JCC forward curve, then the  hedge relationships may be estimated.  However, I have been unable to  determine a rigorous approach to building the JCC curve.     I can explain this far better in person, and would like to talk as soon as  possible at your convenience.   -Kevin Kindall Marc De La Roche marc.roche@enron.com enron.com Kevin Kindall kevin.kindall@enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com  Stinson Gibner stinson.gibner@enron.com  Doug Leach doug.leach@enron.com

__label__Save	P+ option valuation model Mark,  After recently reviewing the booking of the P+ options, it is my understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread=  option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are assumed to be correlated Geometric Brownian Motion processes  (i.e. the pri= ce process assumptions are consistent with standard Black-76 model assumptions=  extended to two commodities).   The payoff for a call option is:  Payoff =3D Max( 0,  A =01) B =01) K).  Where:  A =3D NXWTI (delivery price for Nymex)  B =3D Posting Price =3D (WTI Swap) =01) (Posting Basis)  K=3D Posting Bonus (fixed).  The only complication of this option as compared to most other spread optio= ns is that leg B of the spread is a combination of three prices,  the two futures prices which make up the WTI swap for the given month, and the average posting basis during the delivery month.   Combination of these prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg B and=  the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of=  prices and its correlation with the NXWTI price.  I believe that this approach is more straightforward than the alternative, which would be to us= e a three or four-commodity model with its associated volatility and correlation matrices.  In summary, I believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of these types of options, assuming that the inputs are set correctly.  Regards,  Stinson Gibner V. P.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research  Group, is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of  talent we have currently in London. Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  its time to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.   My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader,  highly respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy  level and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.  His promotion is likely to cause Anjams departure form Enron. I value  technical skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, dont think he is the  same caliber as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to  Houston for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a  sufficient incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has  greatly improved.  Please, let me know what you think.

__label__Save	Floating LNG Terminal Folks,  As a follow-up to Scott Neals inquiry this morning concerning  portable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no  such capability currently exists. According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this  opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far  as we know, has constructed such a vessel.    I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the  Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they  have not built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel  would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required  operational and  environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.

Fundamentally, it seems like the long-term  vol should be similar for a given commodity regardless of geographic location.  Has Research done any work on this in the past?

I sent the Excel file  with crude oil data as an e-mail attachment earlier this afternoon, and when  I checked my mail just now, I discovered that it had been rejected because of  its size.  I have reduced the amount of data somewhat by using the following  limitations: WTI Crude Oil swap transactions only, starting from January 1,  2001, with delivery in the USA. This allowed me to get rid of some  unnecessary fields. Please note that there are no calendar spread options or  basis options included in the data, and, as this is from Claytons database,  it does not include failed trades or limit-order trades.  The Excel file (Crude Data) can be found in:  O:\_Dropbox\Tom Barkley  I have started looking at the data already, but it does not seem possible to  plot all 24000+ points in one Excel chart. I hope this helps.

__label__DontSave	On the status of the EOL Project ---------------------- Forwarded by Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT on 11/28/2000  12:29 PM ---------------------------    Clayton Vernon @ ENRON  11/28/2000 12:10 PM   To: Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: EOL Project  Vasant-  As we speak, I am in the process of working thru the bugs in the new software  product, Data Beacon, commercial has purchased for OLAP.  OLAP refers to Online Analytical Processing. The term is somewhat a misnomer.  The analyses capable by OLAP are not extensive. What OLAP is is a viewer of  empiric data. It is to data as a browser is to published pages.   Data Beacon is a gorgeous product, Vasant, and it will permit easy  tabulations and reporting from even the largest databases, including EOL. I  have continued to listen and store every EOL trade (now over 500,000 of them)  and the resulting cube contains well over 1,000,000 records.  Within  minutes, you will be able to come to any slice of the data you want, and view  it in any format (table, graph, chart) you want, and export it to any  software you want. You can save thiese views and come back to them with a  click of the mouse.  The EOL listener, parser and marking-to-market run as compiled C code. They  are completely stable- they have been running for three weeks now without  fail since the last re-boot of the server. They automatically restart if the  server reboots.  The second part of the EOL  project is SAS. It has been paid for by  commercial, and I have worked very hard to facilitate the installation of it  and the training in it. I have personally instructed over 30 people here at  Enron in its use.  Where we are is an ongoing installation of Data Beacon, which should be  finished today or tomorrow. It will take me one day to write the scripts to  automatically refresh the cube as information arrives. Then, it will take  me one day to make sure the dimensioning of the cube is appropriate.   Finally, we have tested a web-based database constructor for the Research  Department, which will prospectively build real time time series databases  for you based on your specific designs.  I will deliver this compprehensive reporting solution to you this week.

__label__DontSave	Re: Short Term Private Firm Model: Static historical snapshot+performance data for model development Amitava,  Thank you for the detailed info on the required data and thoughts on its scope.  Ill discuss it with Mike and Eric this morning.  Also agree that well almost assuredly save money in the long run by building a more robust model off more comprehensive data to start with.  Cheers, Scott     Amitava Dhar 26/04/2001 21:23 To: Mike Mumford/LON/ECT@ECT, Eric Kirkpatrick/EU/Enron@Enron, Scott Salmon/EU/Enron@Enron cc: Iris Mack/ENRON@enronXgate, Vasant Shanbhogue/Enron@EnronXGate, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Craig Chaney/Enron@EnronXGate   Subject: Short Term Private Firm Model: Static historical snapshot+performance data for model development  Mike, Scott, Eric,  After brainstorming and discussing further on data here, we think that our final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows: We need bankrupt, default and nondefault (which covers nonbankrupt) accounts with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following the latest snapshot.  Monthly performance indicator need to be available for the entire 12 months performance period.  We will need all the bankrupt and default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights. For the purpose of model validation, we will need data with above specs covering 16 months of performance.  This means that we will need rolling (4 quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data for 4 monthly shifts:  Input snapshots           Performance 1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end, 1999 December end   12 month end performance for Jan 2000 through Dec 2000 1999 Feb end, 1999 May end, 1999 August end, 1999 November end    12 month end performance for Dec 1999 through Nov 2000 1999 Jan end, 1999 Apr end, 1999 July end, 1999 October end     12 month end performance for Nov 1999 through Oct 2000 1998 December end, 1999 Mar end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end    12 month end performance for Oct 1999 through Sep 2000  We will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator, if available during the performance period.  Our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90+ days delinquency on any trade credit. We have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big picture, it makes sense to spend  the extra amount to get the right data for analysis. Please let me know your thoughts.  This will require D&B to give us a modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly.

__label__Save	Re: Houston Research Opportunity: Anjams plight Grant,  I agree. We shall give him an offer of a job in Houston (on the terms we discussed with)  plus an option to stay in London, if he does not like Houston.  His choice. I think we extended a very  generous offer to him and he may have an excessive perception of his contribution to Enron.  Vince         Enron North America Corp.    From:  Grant Masson                           08/09/2000 02:41 PM    To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: Houston Research Opportunity: Anjams plight    Vince:  I got the following note from UK HR after had a call from them earlier  today.  I told them that the deal you and I communicated to Anjam was firm  and not negotiable (with the exception of the issues regarding the flat  rental).  Apparently, Anjam is trying to play hard ball.  Whats your  commitment to Anjam?  Should we explore a package deal? My vote is no.  Grant.     Tara Rozen 08/09/2000 12:17 PM To: Grant Masson/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Melanie Doyle/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Houston Research Opportunity  Grant  Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in our attempt to convince Anjam that he  should transfer on a local US package. The difficulty is not so much the  compensation and benefits, it seems more to do with the actual job and  long-term prospects. He will only, therefore, commit to 12 months and only on  assignment terms.   We explained to Anjam the rationales for transferring locally, ie not just  cost but equitability among his peers. He is convinced that his skills and  Enron knowledge are valueable enough to warrant an assignment rather than a  local deal. Also, he was apparently told by Vince that it was impossible for  you to find a local hire for this role as you were not paying the market  rate.   Would you like to move further with this? If so, we can put together costs  for you for a 12 month assignment and see what you think. I am out tomorrow  but back in on Friday and could do it for you then.  Let us know!

I felt that it would be useful to  bring Melanie Doyle, my HR rep, into the equation.  I met Melanie this  morning to discuss the issues with respect to taking up the offer in  Houston.  I explained that the interest for this opportunity is mutual, mine  from a career progression perspective and Houston Researchs to fill an  urgent need.  Melanie, having had experience with these transfers before, has  kindly agreed to help out from an HR perspective, probably involving some of  the London/Houston team that are usually responsible for these situations.  I  expect that you may receive a call from either Melanie or a foreign  assignment representative in the near future.  I would like to re-iterate my interest in the opportunity, but would like to  make a counter-proposal for the form of the contract; I would like to make  the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one-year assignment working  with Tanya, and then re-evaluate the situation at the end of the year in  terms a new role for me in Houston thereafter, subject to mutual agreement.   The alternative situation of resigning from Enron Europe and re-joining Enron  Corp is too dramatic and requires me to burn bridges and my return to Enron  Europe would be difficult.  Also, I would lose the valuable support  structures available to me in London.  The amount of any fixed costs  (flights, modest cargo, a few months of mortgage carrying cost) are entirely  reasonable, not excessive given my single status and not so great that they  justify making the contract a three year (local) one.  I would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1/2 years solid experience &  value-added at Enron Europe, the value of several million pounds I have  identified & justified to external auditors for Enron Europe this year and an  Excellent rating (my fourth making my 3 1/2 yr average rating also  Excellent), I could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal (i.e. my  existing Enron Europe salary & benefits package plus a reasonable one-off  allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses).  Regards & thanks again for the opportunity,  Anjam x35383 Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com enron.com Grant Masson grant.masson@enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com  Dale Surbey dale.surbey@enron.com

__label__DontSave	UT McCombs research project on online energy trading exchanges - firm capabilities and environmental complexities Vince,  Greetings.  I am forwarding to you the following research request from three of my Business School colleagues.  Best, Ehud   Dear Trustee of the Center for Energy Finance:  Three professors of the McCombs business school, Dr. Sirkka Jarvenpaa, Dr. Emerson Tiller, and Dr. Kerem Tomak are conducting a research project in alliance with the Center for Energy Finance on B2B online energy trading systems.  All three researchers both conduct research and teach in the area of electronic commerce (strategy & policy, economics, and technology).  They are seeking your help at this time.  They would like to interview an executive in your firm who is in charge of managing or participating in an online energy trading exchange. They are looking beyond the first-order effects of B2B exchanges-- benefits of dramatically reduced costs, greater access to buyers and sellres, and improved market liquidity -- to second order effects (e.g., redesign of  broader firm processes, greater innovation,  standardization, etc.) and broader organizational and environmental drivers and barriers (institutional and regulatory structures, associations, and alliances). This is a research project that aims to accumulate insight into firm capabilities and environmental complexities involved in B2B energy exchanges. At this time, they are focusing on one industry, energy trading. They are conducting interviews with owners and operators of proprietary exchanges as well as owners of member-based exchanges in energy trading.  The researchers would like you to kindly pass this request for a 45 minute phone interview to a person in your firm whom most closely deals with your firms strategy for B2B exchanges. We would like to conduct the interviews during December and January.  The appropriate executive or his/her assistant can directly contact Dr. Sirkka Jarvenpaa for scheduling the interview.  Thank you so much for your assistance and support.

__label__DontSave	Enron Announcement Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers  Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:  National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).    The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enrons total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).  National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers needs.  Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.  When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected:  1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it.  2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage.  ** IMPORTANT *** These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)  To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enrons preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in Nationals and Alamos preferred traveler programs.  Nationals Emerald Club membership and Alamos Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

__label__DontSave	 Hi Vince,          My name is Maria Teresa Aguilera-Peon, I forwarded you the emails from Dr. Kloucek a few weeks ago.  I know that you must be very busy, but I was wondering if you would have time to meet with me sometime, perhaps over lunch.  See, I graduated from Rice (majored in Applied Math) a couple of years ago, and I am considering a PhD in Financial Math. I would like to work in idustry afterwards, not academia.  But I am wondering what type of jobs there are for people like that in companies like Enron, and I figured you would be a good person to ask.  So if you find yourself with a little free time I would be very grateful to be able to ask you a few questions.  Thanks!

__label__Save	Re: Aluminium Asian Digital Options Anjam,  We can use moment matching to find the effective volatility and dividend  yield for the average. Then we can apply the European digital option formula.   Attached please find  the c-code I did for  Asian spread option, when I find the effective vol and drift for both  averages then find the option value by calling the European spread option.  You can do just the same for  the Asian digital option.  It would be nice to do a Monte-Carlo, just checking the accuracy of the  approximation.  It was nice to have you here, we are impressed by the work you have done. Keep up the good work.  Zimin            Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe    From:  Anjam Ahmad                           07/27/2000 10:14 AM    To: Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Aluminium Asian Digital Options  Hi Zimin,   Russell Placket of MG Metals just talked to me about the issue of pricing a  strip of twelve monthly Asian digital options on LME aluminium.  As I  understand, the payoff to the customer is a fixed cash amount that wil be  paid if the average of the closing prices of aluminium for a month are  greater than the strike agreed in advance, where holiday days do not  contribute to the average.  Russell mentioned that this would be a set of 12 monthly options starting in  Jan-01, and that the LME price for Jan-01 of $1572.5 (which is the future  converging to the spot price on the 3rd Wednesday in Jan 01) can be used as a  proxy/estimate for the average for the month.  Do you have a model for asian digitals or should I proceed with Monte Carlo  to price this, maybe using European digital option model as control variate?

__label__Save	Vega V@R, Credit Reserve Model update Attached is a draft of the Vega VaR implement documentation.  We will discuss  this issue tomorrow.  Index VaR and the Vega VaR status: Because any modification of the VaR model has to be coded into the new  version by IT,  the Index VaR model and the Vega VaR model are on the waiting  list to get into  IT groups door.  Currently, they are struggling with the  Credit Model.  Accord to Jonathan Le, they will implement the Prudency  model after the Credit and before anything else.  So, its uncertain when  they can begin these two projects.  Credit Reserve Model status: New version developed by IT is still in the debugging stage.  Two major  difference exist between the new and old versions: 1)  Old version uses delta-gammar methodology, new version uses full  evaluation.  IT group is not comfortable with their implementation of the  Spread option and Swaption evaluation.  I am working with them on it. 2) Insurance projects are new to the new version.  IT also wants our help too.  Only after the IT finishes the debugging process, could we start testing the  new version with the current one.  Thanks.

__label__Save	New Businesses in London: Weather & Insurance Hi Vince,  Talking to the staff in London, I heard that Lynda Clemmons and a few of the  key Weather Desk members left to start their own business.  I am hearing that  London may gain more independence from Houston and gain its own book and,  interestingly, also having ideas about developing the insurance/ insurance  derivatives market.  I therefore thought this might be a useful opportunity  to formalise a gradual transfer of responsibility for weather deal pricing  from Joe to myself plus start talking to Vasant about the new markets on the  insurance side.

The following are some of the items that we discussed during own phone call:  -  attached is a copy of the introduction of the book.  section 1.2 provides a content overview  -  we are planning to market the book globally, and feel the market size  is around 3000 -  the authors names are Dr Chris Stickland and Dr Les Clewlow   -  Mini bio of authors:  Dr. Les Clewlow and Dr Chris Strickland hold Associate Research Positions at both the School of Finance and Economics, University of Technology, Sydney and the Financial Options Research Centre, University of Warwick, UK.  Together, they have over 20 years combined experience in the financial and energy derivative markets and have published many articles in academic and trade journals.  They are the authors of the book Implementing Derivatives Models (Wiley, 1998) and editors of Exotic Options: The State of the Art (ITP, 1998).  Their forthcoming book Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management is due to be published during the second quarter 2000.  Currently, their interests are concentrated in the energy derivatives area, where they have developed a wide range of pricing tools for electricity options and other energy derivatives.   Could you please provide responses to the following: -  Would it be OK if we use the logo for Enron, the global company? -  What will you need from us before printing?  If you need to review the book jacket or the manuscript, please let us know. -  If Enron needs to review anything, how long will it take for Enron to turn it around? -  We are putting together a leaflet advertising our energy course.  We would like to mention the forthcoming book and that it is being sponsored by Enron...is this OK with you?  No logo will be used. -  We would like to produce a leaflet / brochure advertising the book as well, but this will follow after we have the book cover designed.  Should I work with Andrew at Stokes Account Ex. on this?  -  How do we handle the money side of things?     The manuscript is not fully completed, but we may begin typesetting any day now.  I think it will take about 3-4 weeks to typeset and then another 3 weeks to print and bind.  Sometime in late April? It looks like we will be in Houston around the 7th of March...will you be around either the 7th or 8th?  I hope you are enjoying your time at home.  Let me know if you need anything further.

__label__Save	Re: Real Options Article Steve,  The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication than RISK MAgazine.  If the article is published it will give you more exposure in  the academic circles.  I think it will be a significant accomplishment.  On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK among the practitioners.  I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK.

__label__DontSave	Hello & Thanks for the Call John:  I received your voice mail upon return to the office this morning.  Im sorry the schedules did not match up yesterday but certainly hope the next opportunity to meet will not be long in coming.  I was most impressed with the quality of students interviewed on campus yesterday.  Likewise, I have now had a chance to meet some of those we have hired while I was in London.  The high standard clearly continues.    Concerning your reference to the annual finance conference, I have kept up with each event from a distance.  Memory serving, it has been about four years since the concept was first considered.  Time flies!  Others have also said that it is a real success.  Many thanks to you and others at Baylor for the time and effort dedicated to date.  Let me know when you have plans to be in Houston in the future.  Ill do the same when in Waco.  Pass on my well wishes to others at the Business School including Dr.(s) Rose and Petty.  I did have a chance to visit with Dr. Maness by phone and exchanged v-mails with Dr. Rose.

__label__DontSave	Energy Committee Minutes from January 23rd Energy Committee Members  The following members were in attendance at the January 23rd meeting: Bruce Williamson, Tina Sivinski, Tim Tipton, Bruce Sukaly, Bob Peebler, Vince Kaminski, Dean Arthur Warga, Praveen Kumar, and Lane Sloan.  The handout material is attached for members that could not attend.  The committee viewed a TV ad  for the Bauer College and a TV news story on the new AIM center and  Cougar Fund.  The first item of business was the Partnership program.  The committee agreed on the following levels:               Trustee            $100,000              Partner                50,000              Investor               25,000              Sponsor              10, 000  For this year,  these levels would receive placements in the new Energy Certificate Programs which will start in September of this year as follows: Trustee up to 10, Partner up to 4, Investor up to 2, and Sponsor 0.   All members of the partnership program would be able to participate in the Learning Community programs of seminars, forums, and symposiums free of charge with the number of attendees and special arrangements varying depending upon the partnership level.  The Chairman noted that with the certificate classes beginning in September, then the annual fee structure would need to align accordingly which left a funding gap for the first part of the year for the marketing costs to launch GEMI.  The original idea had been for the one time entrance fee in the Partnership Program to cover these costs but as you recall the committee did not favor that approach.  The Chairman asked the committee to provide ideas on how to fund these marketing efforts originally targeted at $200,000 for this year.  Dr. Kumar discussed three energy certificate programs to be available as 1) Risk Management 2) International Project Finance, and 3) Energy Accounting. The courses can be fully developed for the Risk Management and Energy Accounting to start programs in September (many already available).  The International Project Finance may require additional time because of development efforts on certain courses.  Dr. Kumar requested that the members identify people in their organizations that could give detailed feedback on the course proposals so we are assured they fit the needs of the Energy community.  We will also begin discussions with Energy committee members on what level of participation your forsee for your company.  Dr. Kumar noted that the BS and MS programs would be underway but less of an issue for course development as students would not be taking these more energy focused courses until junior and senior years.  He said that specialized training programs seemed to be of high interest and more activity than originally anticipated.  The chairman covered the feedback on the seminars, forums and conferences. There was real interest in seminars and forums but committee members did not recommend pursuing conferences at this time.  The plan would be to have in steady state 3 seminars per year which would be for large audiences with a featured speaker.  It was noted that the venue would be an important consideration to attract appropriate audiences.  Various suggestions were given on topics of interest with an overall view that the presentations should be practical and of high quality. The committee agreed that a reasonable fee should be charged to non members of the partnership program. The feedback on the forums was that they should be smaller more focused groups with different formats depending upon the subject matter.  The thought was that they could address overarching issues integrating energy and service sector considerations. Non members would not participate but selected student participation was seen as valuable.  A new concept of symposiums was introduced based on discussion with various committee members.  The idea of a symposium was to bring together important spokespeople and other key participants on a topic of high interest to the Energy community. The Bauer College would provide a coordinating role to address the issue with the objective of gaining input on all fronts.  Dr. Kumar noted that there had been various discussion with members around current topics emanating from the Enron collapse such as clearing house and credit risk considerations.  The committee was quite enthused that an imporant event could be created but it needed to be very carefully thought out as to topic and the management of the process including the media.  It was discussed that if the Bauer College wanted to sponsor such an event then it would need to provide a project manager.  Committee member companies would need to provide assistance/advice particularly on coordinating the media. Dr. Kumar will be sending out an e-mail to get your input.  Then Dean Warga would make a decision on whether to pursue such a significant event which could be a great launch vehicle for GEMI but also carried a series of risks.  Next, Dr. Kumar discussed briefly the trading center noting that the key issue was endowment funding before any significant activity could take place.  The college was continuing to think through the content and integration with other aspects of GEMI, the AIMs investment center, etc.  The Chairman then discussed GEMIs overall marketing image.  There was some fine tuning of the proposal providing further clarity and emphasis of key aspects of GEMI but in general a high consensus on the desired image contained in the attachment.  After the dialogue on the symposium, which would be a major marketing effort in an of itself, the discussion on external and internal promotion was tabled til next meeting.  The chairman noted that there would probably be a need for a two tier approach if the symposium effort was pursued.  The major focus initially being on the symposium then coupled with a growing effort on the overall GEMI marketing over the next several months.  The last item was the competitive assessment/relationship with other universites and organizations where the chairman discussed the current approach and principles in the attachment.  This received good support from the committee.  The committee members recommended the next meeting to occur in six weeks.  I will send out a separate e-mail on possible dates for you to consider.

__label__Save	Enron/Stanford Program Hello Vince, Stinson,  Thank you very much for hosting my visit at Enron. I had a very pleasant time there, and I found the meetings very informative.  As discussed during my visit at Enron, I am sending you below a DRAFT of the letter that would be needed to get the program in place and rolling, and start the students working on it. It took a while to find out what the appropriate process was and how the letter should be structured. Sorry for the delay.  If I may, Id like to visit Enron again, sometime in August, to define the research agenda more precisely and prioritize the problems to look at. Im in frequent contact with Giuseppe, who is impressed by the environment there. We are trying to formulate the research issues and problems to study, that would be of interest to Enron.  The plan is this:  1) By August, Giuseppe will have been there for almost 2 months and will probably have a relatively good understanding of the Enron problem space.  2) I will work together with Giuseppe till August to formulate a set of good problems of: a) high practical importance b) high innovation potential c) serious scope.  3) I could  visit in August (say mid-August or so) to: a) discuss these problems with you and get your feedback b) prioritize the problems and evaluate their impact c) make sure were on the same page regarding research strategy and execution path.  I hope we can fully set up the program at Stanford before then, so that I can bring on board one more Ph.D. student to start his doctoral work in this area.  Im all excited about our collaboration. I am even thinking of starting a research seminar at Stanford, specifically on these research issues!  Talk to you soon.

I am wondering whether research is looking into the application  of extreme value theory to power and esp. to weather. In a recent news  article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t_max, t_min,  etc.   I am in particular referring to the news article below:  http://213.219.22.254/i-wex/resources/ef290600.htm  In the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for  t_max, t_min, or below or above precipitation structures. The choice in the past has been the burn analysis on historical data. However, we are in  particular interested in the extreme events, and the application of EVT could  provide a meaningful tool for the analysis.   Has the research group looked into the application of EVT to weather? EVT has  a long history of application in hydrology (which would cover parts  of the precipitation structures...). Also, research (esp. at ETH in Zuerich)  is indicating the application of EVT to V@R....   Thank you!

__label__Save	transport model Andy,  The scale effect in the transport model can be explained.   I use a European option to do the illustration.  I raise the underlying and strike price by the same amount, use the fuel  percentage to adjust the strike. The net result is the intrinsic value decreases as the level goes up.  If the fuel percentage is not very high, the option premium actually  increases with the level, although the intrinsic value decreases.    If the fuel percentage is very high (>8%), then we see a decreasing option  price.  In the transport deal, fuel change is often below 5%, so you will not see a  decreasing spread option price when NYMEX moves up.  So I think the transport model still does what it  should do.   Zimin   In the following exmaple, I used r=6%, vol%, T=100days, see spreadsheet  for details.                ---------------------- Forwarded by Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT on 10/20/2000 01:24 PM  ---------------------------   Zimin Lu 10/20/2000 10:45 AM To: Andrew H Lewis/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Colleen Sullivan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: level effect in transport    Andy,  The following spread sheet domenstrates the leve effect in transport  valuation.

Vince      Murphy, Bernard <Bernard.Murphy@caminus.com> on 03/01/2001 09:18:58 AM To: Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com <Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com> cc:   Subject: RE: 1997 Risk paper on Pricing of Electricity Derivatives   Vince,  I can send you a Scientific Word DVI file (at the weekend) if you can read SCientific Word files ?  The dissertation hasnt been reviewed by Les or the External yet - although its been at FORC for 2 months. I think that the Empirical Chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance to both our companys businesses - although I ultimately didnt have the time to explicitly price the jump risk-premium which I conjectured is possibly implicit in the prices of exchange-traded electricity futures-options - rather I developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable a rough assessment (with a little bit of further work, but not too much) be made of the price of jump risk in wholesale power markets.  In other words, I assumed spot jump-risk to be undiversifiable, and essentially devoted 2 Theoretical Chapters to :  1) proving that a jump-diffusion trading model is incomplete (synthesising the securities markets framework with martingale representation theory) - note that I did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed with term structure securities as in the HJM w/ jumps papers of Shirakawa and Das and;  2) deriving an explicit risk-adjustment process for implementing the price of jump-risk using a jump-diffusion marginal indirect utility of wealth process (ie. a jump-augmented production economy approach in the spirit of CIR, Bates, Ahn & Thompson).   Incidentally, I would be keen to find out if you or any of your team done much work on real-asset valuations in a spark-spread option-valuation framework ?  Im about to start a project evaluation of embedded optionality, and have a dilemna whether I should model the spot or forward gas / power price processes.  With the former, I can model mean-reversion and jumps explicitly (obviously, important for capturing the optionality of out-of-the-money plant, which might otherwise be ignored in a pure-diffusion framework) but am not maximising the informational content of the available market data (that is, assuming there was a long-term market forward curve for electricity); whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition means that I have to capture mean-reversion via the futures volatility function, and jumps are less easy to calibrate.  Any suggestions ?

__label__Save	Re: Generation Earnings Model Michelle, I agree with you that we need to run AT LEAST 500 iterations.  But I did not realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations. Helen and I talked  earlier about using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts  and run the parts separately on different processors, then aggregate the results. This procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time. Looks like we have to do it this way now.  Buying a more powerful computer helps but  does not solve the problem.   In addition, we might want to re-consider if writing the code in VB is  optimal. I was assured at the very beginning that VB runs as fast (if not faster) as C, but some re-assurance from IT group on this issue is helpful.

Last week we ran Calpine using 46 days  of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations. The 100 iteration  run took 16 hours to run. To run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of  data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days. We are  concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be  increased to at least 500 iterations.   We are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful  than the test computer we have been using. Do you have any suggestions as to  how we can improve the process?

__label__DontSave	P/L Breakout This analysis was another swag at p&l components. We took the numbers from the daily position reports, backed out the big originations that we new about (e.g. peakers sales) and the other mistakes (e.g. the EES $700MM loss), then took out the curve-shift P&L from the backtest data, the balance we said must be some form of new deal P&L plus realised p&l etc. It shows that 2000 was the prop trading year, whereas 2001 was mainly new deals. Of course the whole thing is poisoned by reserve movements. Port, David </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DPORT> david.port@enron.com enron.com Kaminski j.kaminski@enron.com 
__label__DontSave	HJM simulation Please find attached the code for the HJM simulation model for option pricing and other necessities. The model takes as inputs prices and volatilities and generates a daily spot price grid and respective transition probabilities - a framework for pricing options of multiple kinds. As it is, the model seems quite flexible and detailed. It takes care of fwd-fwd volatilities and uses different factor loadings for each month - this means that the model takes different PCAs as as the curve shrinks in time. Also, the user may define as many factors as the size of # of points in the fwd curve. One interesting aspect is the way I evolved the spot price to provide convergence to the prompt month price as the month approaches its end. Before shocking prices (spot and fwds) I get the expected spot for the next day by linear interpolation with the prompt fwd. By ensuring convergence, however, the model creates a spot price vol that converges to the prompt month vol. The phenomena is illustrated in the spreadsheet example where I call the model for each day of the first month to calculate the respective daily expected prices and vols. As usual, I put the whole project on o:\research\common\project\options\HJM. It is self-contained - no need for other files and the whole source code is there. To see the the spreadsheet you need to install the fwd-fwd vol function and the loading factor function. You will find these things on o:\research\custom. Note that this is not necessary to run the model itself. It just makes the spreadsheet more illustrative and the code more understandable. Regarding the last, I tried as much as possible to make the code clear and lean hoping that you feel confortable with its pieces and usability.             These are the files:  HJMsim.c - Main file  HJM.c - Where the simulation is actully run  Support.c - set of support functions for the simulation (fwd-fwd, PCA, etc...)  NRC.c - set of NRC functions I used (changed variables from float to double)  NRUTIL.c - modified to accomodate memory management of double tensors   Please let me know your opinion and the bugs.

I did not take any pen back, I lost my pen too somewhere in Enron.  As I mentioned to you, after I got my Ph.D in 1999, I have been working two years as Lead Scientist and Science Manager in energy division at PROS Revenue Management Inc. in Houston.  I developed and implemented the mathematical models for Trading Optimization System and Firm Transportation Optimization System.  The Trading Optimization System becomes the most popular product in the industry this year. Duke Energy just signed the contract to buy this product yesterday.  Conoco and Williams also signed the contracts for it. According to PROS Sales Department, the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15 companies in one or two years.  Enron is the ideal place for me to continue my research and system developing efforts to combine revenue management with risk management. I am confident that I can make significant contributions to Enron in this area.  I would like to thank you again for giving me this opportunity to come to Enron for this interview. I am looking forward to having the opportunity to work in Enron.  Sincerely Yours   Jacob    --- Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com wrote: > Jacob, > > It was nice meeting you.

__label__Save	India Database Jim/Wade,  As you are aware, I have been working with Vinces group on the Henwood model  data.  The target was to have data on all India plants collected by Jan. 15th.  We all know that getting power out o Maharashtra holds the key to being able  to solve the Dabhol challenge.  With all of your help, this model can become  the tool that tells us exactly how that can be done, and at what prices.  We are a substantial part of the way there on data collection, and have got  data of some 1500 plants across the country.  The spreadsheet for the same is  attached.  This will help you answer any questions that come up in calls  about the various plants.  Please note that we are located in the Western  Region, or WR in the spreadsheet.  We will be further scrubbing the data and  getting more recent and accurate information, especially on Maharashtra over  the next 2-3 days.    The Henwood team will be in India on Sunday, and will compare notes with the  team here.  I am arranging for a presentation on the model and what it will  do.    Wade - It would be good if a broad section of the team attend, including  Neil, yourself and Mohan.  I will talk to you about a convenient time for you  in this regard.  Neil & Mohan - Over the next week (Monday and Tuesday) I will need some time  from Vivek, Anshuman, Ravi, and a few others, to interact with the Henwood  team.  I will be abliged if you can make that possible.  The first phase of model runs (which will be done by Jan. end) will just give  us some more basic information, but I will need all of your inputs in order  to ask the right questions.  The idea is that as we go along, this model will  be used to answer all types of management questions concerning Dabhol, and  power evacuation out of Maharashtra.  This will be critical for the team going forward.  Regards, Sandeep.

This student has excellent technical skills, including an M.S. in Statistics and a Ph.D. in Economics by the end of the current academic year.  His dissertation research is on the investment behavior of Independent Power Producers in the US.  As a result of research assistance he has done for me, he knows the California market very well and is familiar with the other ISOs.  I think he would be an excellent match for you.  The only problem is that he will probably have many other options available.  However, I definitely think hes worth a look. If youd like him to send you a CV, please let me know.  Thanks.

__label__Save	Alliance Info Alert: FERC Report on Western Markets At its special meeting today, FERC released the results of its eagerly  awaited probe into Californias summer power crisis, concluding that under  certain circumstances, California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and  unreasonable power rates due to Californias seriously flawed market  structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions  throughout the West.  The FERC staff report on western markets and the causes of the Summer 2000  Price Abormalities, entitled, Part I of Staff Report on U.S. Bulk Power  Markets, is available at the following website:  http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm  In response, FERC issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural  changes to the California ISO and PX to help remedy the pricing problems, and  solicited public comment by November 22.  A technical conference has also  been scheduled for November 9, to discuss the proposed solutions and other  remedies that might be suggested (details TBA).  While all four commissioners  supported the order, the order stretched the Commission.  Chairman Hoecker  and Comm. Breathitt expressed strong endorsements, while Comms. Hebert and  Massey concurred, citing areas where they felt the Commission had either  over-reached or not gone far enough, as discussed below.  A final order is  expected to be issued by years end.  At the same time, the Commission warned California consumers of their  continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve  state issues, such as: (1) immediately implementing the availability of day  ahead markets for power purchases; (2) development of demand responses; (3)  siting of generation and transmission; and (4) assurance of sufficient  reserve requirements.  Highlights of Proposed California Structural Remedy  In its order, FERC proposed a series of market overhauls, including:  (1) Eliminating the states mandatory requirement that the states  investor-owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX, and allowing these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other  alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks.  (2) Requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their  transactions in the day-ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for  under-scheduling (in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements), in  order to discourage over-reliance on the real-time spot market.  (3) Establishing independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the ISO  and PX.  (4) Modifying the current single price auction system by (a) imposing a  temporary $150/MWh soft cap that prohibits supply bids in excess of $150  from setting the market-clearing price for all bidders; (b) requiring sellers  bidding above $150/MWh to report their bids to FERC on a confidential, weekly  basis and provide certain cost support; and (c) requiring the ISO and PX to  report monthly information on such bids.  The Commissions price mitigation  measures would remain in effect through December 31, 2002.  (5) Declining to order retroactive refunds for the states ratepayers and  utilities, citing insufficient authority to do so, but subjecting sellers to  potential refund liability for transactions from October 2, 2000 until  December 21, 2002, but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs, if  FERC finds non-competitive behavior.  (6) Encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand  response management programs.  Separately, the draft order rejected the ISOs request for an extension of  its current purchase price cap authority, and the PXs request for price  capping authority.  Commissioner Responses  Comm. Herbert reluctantly concurred, noting that his decision may change when  a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at  the November 9 meeting.  He stressed that he would have preferred that the  order address four areas: (1) eliminate all price controls in California  markets; (2) abolish the single price auction entirely; (3) terminate the  buy and sell mandate in the PX; and (4) direct the ISO to address a long  list of cited problems in its January 2001 RTO filing, rather than having the  Commission prescribe specific remedies.  Hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the soft cap  concept, if one had to be adopted, then the soft cap should increase  incrementally increase over time at specific pre-announced dates.  He  believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in  facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive  for California regulators to address market design and other flaws.  Also, he  would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time, but  allow the ISO and PX to address this issue in their January 2001 RTO  filings.  In addition, he would not dictate risk management methods,  preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on  their own.  Finally, he advised Californians not to be so environmentally  focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation  capacity.  Comm. Breathitt stated her approval of the Order while warning that FERC  cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress  towards open and competitive markets.  She noted that it was the Commissions  job to guide the market to self-correct and not to conduct command and  control.  She also commended the managers of the ISO and PX, saying that  they have performed admirably.  However, she noted she is awaiting comments  on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential  reporting requirements.  Comm. Massey concurred, but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive  approach.  He feels that the Congress has put its thumb on the scale in the  Federal Power Act to protect consumers.  Stating that prices will continue to  be unreasonable in the future, he believes that this Order moves in the right  direction, by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over  reliance on the spot market, lack of demand response, the need to  reconstitute governance of the ISO and PX and the elimination of the buy/sell  mandate.  Comm. Massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the  $150/MWh soft cap went far enough, whether FERC has the legal authority to  issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a  certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market  price volatility.  Finally, Chairman Hoecker stated his strong support of the Order, but noted  that this is no time to pull punches.  He emphasized that the Commission  needed frank comments from the industry.  He echoed Comm. Breathitts warning  that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on  track.  Noting that the Commission lacked authority to order refunds, he  stated that the responsibility rests with Congress.  Addressing  jurisdictional issues, he stated that siting problems encountered at the  state level are slowing the meandering transition to competition.  He feels  that the state of California and FERC need to work together to resolve these  problems and that FERC is not attempting to usurp power.  Rather, California  is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region  for reliable energy, thus placing the burden on federal action to make things  work, Hoecker maintained.  The Chairman also said that the Commission will  fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further  evidence provided by staffs ongoing investigation.

It ran as high as $2.08 per MMBtu before expiring up $0.098 at $2.006 per MMBtu, but still down 23% from when it began as the prompt month at $2.619 per MMBtu. The March contract rose $0.083 to $2.067 per MMBtu. The expiration was the lowest since Octobers $1.83 finish in late September. And prospects remain bearish for the new prompt March contract, surrounded by bearish technical and fundamental signals. Look for support at $1.76-$1.80. Mild weather across much of the nation and the huge storage excess sent prices mainly downward all month. Traders saw funds covering short positions during the morning, with trading houses covering in the early afternoon. Locals, which were short near the close, started buying. The market still carries a huge $0.965 forward carry between the February-March contract and January 2003. The larger that forward carry, the more bearish the market can be. Look for more short-covering before selling brings the market back down. The AGA will release its weekly  storage report this afternoon. Expect a withdrawal of about 110 - 120 Bcf. The 5-year average for the week is 150 Bcf.  A year ago there was a draw of 128 Bcf. Yesterdays estimated volume was 127,000 contacts, with 47,000 of those hedge or spreads. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to down $0.05 yesterday as cold weather moves back into the Midwest. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.05 to $1.97 per MMBtu. -------------------------------------------------------------  Exploit the enterprise-wide transaction management power deployed by the big names in gas.

Merrill Lynch invited managing directors and senior executives to invest in the partnerships after it helped Enron raise $349 million for the partnership from pension funds and other institutional investors. Critics say that some investment banks may have been less stringent in their scrutiny of Enron because senior executives were doing business with it and had a vested interest in its profits, raising questions about conflict of interest. The investments may be subject to congressional examination after the House Energy and Commerce Committee subpoenaed Enrons partnership records, including the identities of investors. Enron has revealed that its former CFO made $30 million from 2 partnerships, including LJM2. Merrill Lynch says that the investment partnership is in line with common industry practices. Merrill Lynch claims that it was offered to qualified external as well as internal investors, which would not be a conflict of interest. ------------------------------------------------------------- ENERGY. @ENERGY(r), FEAs Complete Suite of Energy Products, BUILT FOR THE FUTURE.  *Manage all your energy risks. *Build and Price deals. *Value physical assets (generation, storage, etc.) *Report and reduce your energy risks  FEA FINANCIAL ENGINEERING ASSOCIATES Inc. http://www.fea.com/?cId=17 main phone number:  1 510-548-6200 email address: info@fea.com ------------------------------------------------------------- PHYSICAL POWER PRICES |            | High  |  Low  | Average | |            | $/MWh | $/MWh |  $/MWh  | | Cinergy    | 19.25 | 18.15 |  18.55  | | ECAR       | 22.00 | 15.75 |  19.50  | | ERCOT      | 19.40 | 17.50 |  18.60  | | Entergy    | 18.00 | 16.00 |  16.95  | | TVA        | 20.40 | 18.65 |  19.35  | | ComEd      | 20.00 | 19.00 |  19.50  | | Nepool     | 27.75 | 27.00 |  27.30  | | PJM West   | 21.50 | 21.00 |  21.25  | | Main       | 20.00 | 17.50 |  18.90  | | MAPP       | 21.00 | 19.50 |  20.00  | | Palo Verde | 26.00 | 23.50 |  24.30  | | Mid C      | 19.50 | 18.95 |  19.15  | | COB        | 22.00 | 21.00 |  21.35  | | 4 Corners  | 25.50 | 23.25 |  24.60  | | Mead       | 26.00 | 24.75 |  25.20  | | NP 15      | 24.25 | 23.50 |  23.70  | | SP 15      | 24.50 | 23.50 |  23.90  |             Power Delivered 1/30 ------------------------------------------------------------- CFTC Says No Enron Market Manipulation      Enron did not try to engage in market manipulation at any futures exchange, according to testimony before the Senate Energy Committee by the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Enron also named Jeff McMahon as president and chief operating officer and Ray Bowen as CFO. Cooper, McMahon and Bowen will take on the task of trying to raise Enron from the ashes after its collapse. Coopers firm specializes in resurrecting bankrupt companies. Cooper is currently handling the bankruptcy reorganization of Greyhound Lines parent Laidlaw Inc, but Laidlaws restructuring is almost complete. Industry experts say that Cooper must now balance the demands of the bankruptcy with running the remaining businesses and handling the lawsuits and investigations related to Enrons collapse. The new CEO says that with more than 19,000 employees worldwide, Enron has real businesses with real value. He said that his team will work closely with the Board of Directors, management and the creditors committee to develop a reorganization plan to maximize value for the companys shareholders. He has already begun working for Enron. Greg Whalley, who had been president and CEO resigned to take a position with UBS Warburg, which acquired Enrons energy trading unit 2 weeks ago. Enron has also agreed to sell businesses and long-term contracts for more than $520 million and relinquished control of Northern Natural Pipeline to Dynegy. Additionally, it plans to sell Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas for about $3 billion. There has been no word of when the Board of Directors will name a new chairman to replace Ken Lay. ------------------------------------------------------------- R. W.

But the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, passed by Congress after a big lobbying effort by Enron, removed over-the-counter and some on-line energy transactions from CFTC control. Those exempted markets made up the bulk of Enrons trading operations. The CFTC is working with the White House on auditing and accounting standards, and the combination of its market supervisory functions under one agency division. Although at least 8 other congressional probes are being conducted into the financial and accounting facets of Enrons demise, the Senate Energy Committees authority is limited to the effects of Enrons meltdown on energy markets and consumers. Legislators at the hearing saw little impact from Enron on US energy markets. Some on the panel referred to it as business failure, not an energy market failure. Even though the chairman of the NYMEX has not call for any greater regulation of over-the-counter markets, he has called on regulators to treat on-line exchanges and traditional pit-based ones equally. ------------------------------------------------------------- Energy Seminars, Inc.

Enron had used profits from its derivatives trading operation, which was little understood by investors, to mask losses in its more visible businesses even as some of its employees may have been fraudulently manipulating those profits. Enron reaped huge profits from derivatives.  But it lost billions on most everything else it did, including projects in fiber-optic bandwidth, retail natural gas and power, water systems and technology stocks, but used its expertise in derivatives to hide these losses. Derivatives are complex financial contracts whose values are linked to underlying variables such as the prices of commodities, stocks or bonds. They are used by sophisticated investors to manage risk. Enrons use of derivatives both outside and inside the company can likely be directly linked to its collapse. On the outside, they were used to create the companys web of off-balance sheet deals with complex financial partnerships known as special-purpose vehicles. After some of those deals went sour, Enron in October took a $1 billion charge against earnings and a $1.2 billion write-down in shareholder equity, triggering its nosedive into bankruptcy. But Enrons derivatives problems ran far deeper than the outside special purpose vehicles. It appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit and loss entries for the derivatives Enron traded. -------------------------------------------------------------             Progas Storage and Services, Inc.

Williams may have to pay $1.4 billion in Williams Communications debt if its credit rating falls below investment grade. It also may owe $750 million in Williams Communications fiber optic-network leases and $250 million in other expenses. Shares of Williams Communications dropped 80% last year as growth evaporated with the dot.com collapse. In the past month, Williams sold securities and cut capital spending to strengthen its balance sheet amid increased scrutiny by credit-rating agencies in the wake of Enrons collapse. It also plans to sell assets to maintain the all-important investment-grade debt rating. Because of the debt review, Williams delayed reporting 4th quarter results that had been scheduled for release yesterday. The review will have no direct impact on Williams Communications business, the company said in a statement. However, the stock market is in the process of evaluating the situation and is assuming the worst. Williams shares fell $5.3, to $18.78 yesterday. Its 7.75% coupon maturing in 2031 fell about $42 to $921 per $1,000 face value from $963. That pushed the yield up to 8.48% from 8.08%. Williamss convertible preferred stock, which was sold this month at $25, tumbled $3.93 to $21.65 per share. Enron had $724 million in losses from telecommunications in the 3rd quarter. Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy protection Monday after it accumulated $12 billion in debt it was unable to repay because of falling sales. Shares Williams Communications fell $0.29 to $1.34 yesterday. ------------------------------------------------------------- FINANCIAL SUMMARY The TSE 300 lost 76.59 points to 7567.14 The CRB Index fell 0.56 points to 187.31 The US Dollar decreased 0.49 points to 119.38 The Dow declined 247.51 points to 9618.24 The S&P 500 dipped 32.42 points to 1100.64 The Nasdaq was down 50.92 points to 1892.99 March NYMEX Crude Oil dropped 0.47 to 19.58 Canadian-US Exchange slid 0.0221 to 1.5904 ------------------------------------------------------------- ENERGY MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE Higher Education for refined product professionals NOW ENROLLING RISK MANAGEMENT COURSES: PROFESSIONAL GASOLINE AND DISTILLATE MANAGEMENT, PETROLEUM MARKETER, and  ADVANCED GASOLINE AND DISTILLATE MASTER LEVEL.

I do not think he would be appropriate for Bryans group -- he needs a person who tracks market developments and understands fundamental data, and although this guy may be good at modeling, we already have Iris and Amitava doing the modeling and looking at data.  At this stage, I would prefer to hire somebody with direct experience in credit analysis (banking, rating agency).  I am worried that if we get another person without data analysis experience, then Amitava will find himself with two people (Iris being the other one) who are both inexperienced in this area, and he will find himself doing a lot of the work anyway.

Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 10:47 AM To: Martin, John  D. Subject: FYI: Oh, the Games Enron Played (from the  Knowledge@Wharton website)... Oh, the Games Enron Played  In the 1990s, Houstons Enron Corp. was Wall Streets darling. It had  thrown out the energy-industry playbook, remaking itself from a staid gas  pipeline company to a high-tech trading firm that created exotic securities for  betting on everything from gas prices to the number of hot days in  summer. Share prices soared from $30 to $90 between 1998 and 2000, as  sales increased from $31 billion to more than $100 billion. Enron executives  gained reputations as the energy industrys visionaries. This fall it all  came apart. Share prices have fallen by 90% this year, including a plunge from  just below $40 to less than $10 this fall. In October, Enron reported a  third-quarter loss of $618 million. The companys massive debt was downgraded to  near junk-bond status, and the CEO and CFO were expelled. Shareholders sued and  the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an  investigation. Finally, the humiliated company, which employs more than  20,000, agreed Nov. 9 to be taken over by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc.  for about $9 billion in stock and $13 billion in assumed debt. It is not certain  the merger will take place since it is subject to regulatory approval and could  be blocked on antitrust grounds. And some news accounts suggest that major  Dynegy shareholders could derail the merger over concerns about inheriting  liabilities from current or future lawsuits by Enron shareholders. The  Enron story is not simply a case of a lone company that played with fire and got  burned. Enron was able to take enormous risks while keeping shareholders in the  dark because it could exploit accounting loopholes for subsidiaries that are  available to most publicly traded companies. Companies like Enron can legally  conceal massive debts because rules require a full accounting of a subsidiarys  balance sheet only when the parent company owns more than half of it. If  Im a shareholder of Enron and I want full and fair disclosure, I would want  information about the entities Enron controls, says Wharton accounting  professor Robert E. Verrecchia. Yet Enron shareholders have never received such  a report. Enrons fate is crucial to the energy industry and other  markets it serves, points out Paul R. Kleindorfer, a professor of public policy  and an expert on deregulation at Wharton. Producers and users of gas, oil,  electricity and other forms of energy rely on Enrons system for trading  futures, forwards, options, swaps and other contracts to get the best prices and  control costs far into the future. Without such a system, deregulation simply  cannot work. If Enrons trading platform were to go down it would not be  a minor loss, Kleindorfer says. It would be a huge loss for the industry?.In  the early 1990s the company single-handedly produced the backbone infrastructure  that has led to a whole industry of broker intermediation. To some  extent, Enron appears to have been a victim of sagging securities prices and  volatile energy costs in 2000 and 2001, and it has lost hundreds of millions by  laying fiber-optic cable for which there is no demand. But although those  factors may have determined the timing of the companys troubles, they were not  the chief cause. Enron appears to have lost enormous amounts of shareholder  money by gambling at its own roulette wheels. In hindsight, we made some  very bad investments in non-core businesses that performed worse than we ever  could have conceived, Chairman Kenneth Lay told analysts last week. How  did Enron get into this mess? Becoming a Market Maker When  it was created in 1985 by the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth,  parent company of Northern Natural Gas, Enrons chief business was the operation  of thousands of miles of natural gas pipeline. Lay became chairman in Feb. 1986.  Then early in the 1990s, the federal government took key steps to deregulate the  energy industry. Previously, large regulated utilities were vertically  integrated, giving them control from wellhead to consumer, Kleindorfer says.  Deregulation effectively broke apart the production, long-range transmission and  local distribution functions, leaving each to a different set of players. A  factory owner, for example, can now buy gas or electricity from number of  producers. To function, a free market such as this needs brokers, or  intermediaries, to create, buy and sell contracts for production and delivery,  and it requires a market maker to facilitate trading, just as the big Wall  Street firms and exchanges facilitate trading in stocks. Enron created that  marketplace. This intermediation activity, or brokerage activity, just  revolutionized the marketplace, Kleindorfer says. Since utilities and  other energy users must line up dependable supplies for many months in the  future, they rely on various forms of contracts specifying quantities, prices  and delivery dates. But before the commodity is delivered, prevailing prices may  go up or down, and a supplier may find it has promised to sell at a price thats  now too low, while a purchaser may find that it could have bought for less than  it had agreed to pay. Suppliers and purchasers therefore use a variety of  derivative contracts to benefit from prices that move in their favor and hedge  in case prices move against them. A company that has contracted to buy a  shipload of liquefied natural gas at a specific price in three months, could,  for a much smaller sum, buy an options contract giving it the right, but not the  obligation, to buy a shipload at a lower price. And it could buy an option  giving it the right to sell at a higher price. Thus it is protected regardless  of whether prices move up or down. This was the business Enron invented.  By permitting competition and price discovery far into the future, it brought to  the marketplace the most efficient pricing and allowed energy users to predict  and stabilize costs far into the future, Kleindorfer says. Having that  information historically, as well as projected into the future, could  revolutionize how you plan your business, he said.  At the heart of  Enrons business strategy was the belief that it could be a big energy player  without owning all the power plants, ships, pipelines and other facilities  involved. Instead, it could use contracts to control the facilities in which  other companies had invested, says Ehud Ronn, director of the Center for Energy  Finance Education and Research at the Red McCombs School of Business at the  University of Texas at Austin. The Center trains masters candidates in the use  of energy securities. (Enron is one of the centers eight corporate  sponsors.) Enron, he says, evolved into something akin to a Wall Street  firm. Enron thought of itself in very similar terms as an investment banker  that wanted to tie up as little capital as possible. By 2001, Enron had  evolved into a market maker for some 1,800 different products, many of them  energy- or Internet-related contracts or derivatives the company had created  itself. They included products allowing customers to buy, sell, hedge or  speculate in markets ranging from traditional commodities like coal, oil, gas  and electricity to cutting edge markets for Internet bandwidth, pollution  emissions, semiconductors, wind energy and many others. Prices for many of these  products were available on the companys free website, giving the energy markets  unprecedented price transparency. Betting on the Weather To  see how these products could be used, consider one of Enrons weather risk  management products meant for utilities, energy distributors, agricultural  companies and financial institutions. A gas utility, for example, might use a  floor to protect its revenue in the event of a mild winter. In exchange for a  premium similar to that paid on an insurance policy, Enron will compensate the  utility for every day between November and March on which the temperature rises  above a set level. The payments would make up for reduced gas sales. In  another form of contract called a swap, or collar, Enron will pay the gas  company a given amount if the number of warm days exceeds a set level. But if  the number of cold days exceeds a threshold, the gas company will make a  payment to Enron. The utility would not have to pay a premium as it would with  the floor, and if it had to pay Enron, the money would come from the extra  revenue received by selling more gas in a colder-than normal winter. To a  layman this might look like betting. We never use that word, says Ronn. The  worst we say is to have a view. In practice, other parties are often  involved in such transactions, taking over the contractual obligation created by  Enron. So, in addition to placing its own bets, Enron serves as a middleman, the  way a stockbroker stands in the middle of a securities trade. Like many  middlemen, Enron has to be in a position to make good on any transaction should  either party default. Otherwise, it would be hard to make a market in these  products. In addition, says Ronn, Enron often has to pay out money before  receiving payment from another party. Finally, Enron needed large amounts of  capital to trade products in its own account, just as a Wall Street firm invests  in stocks on its own in addition to executing customers trades. To accomplish  all this, Enron needed vast amounts of capital. You do need to have liquidity  in huge numbers, Ronn says. This created a dilemma. A public company can  raise capital by selling additional shares, but current shareholders dont like  that because the new shares dilute the value of their holdings. The alternative  is to borrow, but large debts hurt a companys credit rating, forcing it to pay  higher interest rates on its loans. Andrew S. Fastow, who became the  companys senior vice president of finance in 1990, found innovative ways to  issue new shares without dilution and to raise capital by selling old-fashioned  assets like power plants and pipelines. He has invented a groundbreaking  strategy, Ted. A. Izatt, senior vice president at Lehman Brothers Inc., told  CFO Magazine in the fall of 1999. Or, as Enron president and CEO Jeffrey  K. Skilling told the magazine: We needed someone to rethink the entire  financing structure at Enron from soup to nuts. We didnt want someone stuck in  the past, since the industry of yesterday is no longer. Andy has the  intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways. He deserves every  accolade tossed his way. Fastow, named chief financial officer in March  1998, told the magazine: We transformed finance into a merchant  organization?.Essentially, we would buy and sell risk positions. A key to the  strategy: Move many of Enrons transactions off the balance sheet. In part,  this involved exploiting a loophole in the securities and accounting  regulations. As noted earlier, debts accumulated by subsidiaries, partnerships  or other entities can be kept off the parent companys books so long as the  parent does not own more than 50% of the entity incurring the debt. By  using so-called unconsolidated subsidiaries, you do not make transparent either  the nature of the investment or the relationship between the parent and the  subsidiary, said Verrecchia. Heavy hitters such as Wall Street analysts and  major shareholders may have the clout to get a company to provide additional  information on subsidiaries. But if youre just an investor picking up Enrons  annual report, you are stuck, Verrecchia added. A Pattern of Sketchy  Details  It has long been clear from company statements and SEC  filings that Enrons off-balance-sheet transactions were enormous, but details  were sketchy because Enron did not have to report them, and chose not to. By  this fall, however, it became obvious these transactions involved huge risks  when Enron acknowledged it had improperly kept some activity off its books.  Putting those debts and losses into Enrons financial statements last month  meant reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. Corrected statements reduced  net income by $96 million for 1997, $113 million for 1998, $250 million for 1999  and $132 million for 2000. At issue were so-called special purpose  entities, or SPEs, set up for a variety of transactions for Enrons benefit.  Enron conceded some of these entities did not meet the accounting standards to  be kept off of Enrons books. In one case, for instance, the entity had  inadequate capitalization for such treatment. In 2000, Enron had  created four entities known as Raptor I, II, III and IV to hedge market risk in  certain of its investments, according to an Enron filing with the SEC. Enron  acquired notes receivable from the Raptors in exchange for an obligation to  issue Enron shares to the entities. But Enron had improperly included the value  of the notes receivable on its books without accounting for the cost of the  shares it would have to issue. In correcting this violation of accounting rules,  Enron said it had overstated its shareholders equity by $1 billion in March and  June 2001. Enron was particularly embarrassed in acknowledging that two  special purpose entities, limited partnerships LJM Cayman and LJM Co-Investment,  had Fastow as the managing partner. Fastow, who according to Enron made in  excess of $30 million in this role, was forced out of the company in October. An  internal committee and the SEC are investigating the use of the  partnerships. Obviously, Fastows role was a problem. If the partnerships  were truly independent entities, he was in a conflict of interest. If he was  running them on Enrons behalf, they were not independent. Despite the  write-downs and disclosures this fall, many analysts complain they still do not  have a full picture of Enrons activities. Enron, for instance, has not fully  described other partnerships it believes it can properly keep off the balance  sheet. Nor is it clear to what extent Enrons losses are due to bad bets it had  made through highly-leveraged derivatives. While a stock market investor can  simply hang on to shares to wait out a downturn, options and other derivatives  typically have expiration dates. If the bet has not turned out as hoped, the  entire investment can be lost. New disclosure was modest and management  did not resolve concerns, Goldman Sachs analysts David Maccarrone and David  Fleischer wrote in an Oct. 24 report to clients. Though Enron had long faced  such criticisms, investors had tended to give the company the benefit of the  doubt because of its strong growth in earnings and acknowledged industry  leading capabilities?, the two analysts said. In other words, when stock  was soaring, investors didnt require details on how it was done. Now they are  crying foul, and a number of shareholder suits have been filed. Essentially,  they claim the company inflated its stock price by filing false financial  statements. Investors who bought shares at those high prices have suffered huge  losses. For years, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets  accounting rules, has had a draft proposal for improving disclosure of  subsidiaries activities and numbers. Essentially, it would move toward a more  qualitative evaluation of whether the parent controlled the subsidiary even if  it owned less than 50% of the stock. Control could be exerted by holding board  seats or through contracts that effectively make the subsidiary a unit of the  parent. What the FASB has promulgated seems to me to be sensible,  Verrecchia said, noting that the whole purpose of accounting is to give an  accurate view of a companys inner workings and true earnings. To conceal  obligations, risk and debt, as Enron and others do, undermines that goal, he  said. But, facing heavy opposition from accountants and corporations, the  FASB has not acted on the draft proposal, citing insufficient support on its  board. So for the time being, off-balance-sheet transactions will continue to be  a common practice among American corporations.

__label__Save	California Update 1/22/01 Executive Summary Discussions continue today over bill AB1X, focus will be on price and term. New legislation introduced today whereby the state will try to save the  utilities from bankruptcy by taking ownership of utilities hydro assets in  exchange for rate increases. Wednesday, state receives bids from auction, rate ranges are expected to be  between 5.5 and 8.0 cents per kilowatt hour. Mid week, audit  findings will be released; audit expected to show PG&Es  utility subsidiary handed over $5B to the holding company. The holding  company used $4.4B to pay shareholder dividends and buyback stock. State commissioned study to see who would benefit more in a possible  bankruptcy scenario.  Bankruptcy still very possible for both        companies. Davis concerned about possible ballot issues and how those may effect futue  solutions or bail out.  Legislation There will be continued discussion regarding bill AB1X in the Senate today.   The discussion will focus on the rate cap of 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour as  well as the term.  Assemblyman Keeley, the author, indicated that he believed  5.5 cents was a fantasy and impossible to obtain.   Today, Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred  Keeley, D-Boulder Creek will introduce legislation whereby the state would temporary or permanently take both PG&E and Edisions hydroelectric  facilities or transmission lines (or both) in exchange for keeping the  utilities out of  bankruptcy.  The state would allow PG&E and Edison to impose rate increases,  however, the rates would not rise beyond the hikes approved earlier this  month by the CPUC as an emergency surcharge.  The money collected from  consumers would go toward paying off their current debt and the state  would then enter into long-term contracts with power generators.  Under the  bill, the state of California would control 10% of all Californias  electricity.  As you  can imagine, this legislation has not received unanimous praise.  According  to recent corporate filings, PG&Es hydroelectric plants alone would be  valued  between $3 and $5 billion.  This amount just happens to be what Davis  estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee  once  the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is  escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the $12 billion in debt.   Davis  is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help  with about $4 billion in debt, while the utilities, of course, say the full  $12 billion should  be covered.   On Wednesday, state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy  suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their  effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come.  Davis  insists there are already several bids for his 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour  ceiling, though few  agree with his opinion.  A handful of smaller, independent electricity  providers with about a 30% share of California power market, indicated Sunday  night they would come down to less than eight cents or less than half of  what they currently charge, in return for the stability of long term  contracts.  Because  consumers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current  PUC rules, any hope California has to work off the back debts for these  utilities lies  in hitting something very close to Davis price cap, without falling back on  higher prices for consumers.  The level of bids will be particularly  important since bond rating agencies moved to put the state of California on a Credit watch on  Friday, worried that there was no obvious long-term repayment plan for the  billions of  dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state.  Utilitys Audit By the middle of this week, California auditors will release their findings  about how much money PG&E and SoCal Edison actually owe to institutions  outside their own holding company structure. This will define the limits of  what the state will guarantee, if they guarantee any of the debt. The truly  explosive  part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of  dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years.  A   source with knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last  three years, PG&Es utility subsidiary handed over about $5 billion to the  holding  company. Of that total, the holding company used $4.4 billion to pay  shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock.   Another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current  power crisis when regulators, at the time of deregulation (under the  direction of  Former R-Gov. Pete Wilson), forced the two utilities to sell at least half of  their power-generating plants.  Auditors are expected to say that if the  utilities  still owned all these plants, electricity would cost only 7 cents a kilowatt  hour, compared with over 30 cents an hour on average in December and January.  Bankruptcy The threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities.  Senior  advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility  companies that  ended in bankruptcy.  As all the parties involved hunker down for another  intensely political week, they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy, but  to push  this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an  advantage.  Under such conditions, the risks of one or more of the players  fumbling and triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy, is still quite high.    Californias political leaders order a series of independent analyses to  determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy, the state or the two  utilities. The short answer was that no one has any idea.  Below are the findings of the  report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge:  1) Would the companies be eligible for Chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy?  Some of the advisors thought that PG&E and Edisons finances were so  bad that Chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option.   Advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate  debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the  companies into full liquidation.   This would most certainly be guaranteed  chaos. 2) Could the bankruptcy court actually force the PUC to raise the price of  electricity to consumers? The legal basis for passing on rate increases to  consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought, particularly if there  is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies.   And  there is still the  question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge. 3) If the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets  seriously and finds that PG&E and Edison cannot afford to buy electricity,  he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages. 4) If the utilities go into bankruptcy, the first creditors in line would be  the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges.  The state could become  almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier   (one of the reasons why suppliers wont sell electricity on credit to these  companies now). 5) If the two companies went bankrupt, it would be the largest bankruptcies  in history, straining just about everyone involved in the process. 6) The corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets  from the utility by the FERC for PG&E and already in place for Edison  may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies  currently think. This is particularly true if this weeks audit shows the two  corporations transferring  billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder  dividend payments.  Davis Opinion polls show that Governor Gray Davis is getting high marks for his  job, and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits.  One of Davis  concerns is, according to a senior official in the Governors office, that a  deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so  anti-utility and  anti-business that it cripples future growth in the state.  According to a  senior official, No one thought Howard Jarvis and his property tax  initiative would  succeed in destroying our education system, but he did, with one just ballot  line and a lot of popular revulsion. The threat of direct, popular action is at least as large now as then.  Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield is  already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that  individual  electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay  their debt through higher rate-payer bills.  This official goes on to say,  The  anger at utility companies is so high here, that almost anything Rosenfield  could think of would pass and we couldnt do anything about it.  This threat  has  begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always  appeared wide open to political leaders -- floating a bond issue or a  guarantee  for the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure,  and then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next  several years.

Prof. Buehler is the  head of the faculty of finance at Mannheim University in Germany. Currently,  he is writing a study about the hedging  strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle. For this study he would  like to get forward oil prices form us.  The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point  for the time period July 1986 and December 1996  with remaining contract durations between one and ten years. It would be  ideal to get this data on a daily basis. Weekly  or monthly data is helpful as well, of course.   Since Mannheim University is among Enrons tier one recruiting universities  in Germany, it would be great if we could help  him with some data. Thanks a lot for your help.  Jens      o.korn@uni-mannheim.de on 10/10/2000 11:44:57 AM To: Jens.Gobel@enron.com cc:    Subject: Daten   Sehr geehrter Herr Goebel,  bezugnehmend auf Ihr heutiges Telefongespraech mit Herrn Prof. Buehler hat mich Prof. Buehler gebeten, Ihnen genauer darzustellen, welche Daten idealerweise fuer unsere Studie benoetigt wuerden.  Zunaechst zum Hintergrund. Wir sind auf ENRON gestossen, weil Eduardo Schwartz in einer seiner Arbeiten die folgende Datenquelle angibt:   In addition to the publicly available futures data described above, for the purpose of this study Enron Capital and Trade Resources made available some proprietary historical forward price curves from 1/15/93 to 5/16/96. From these data ten forward prices were used in estimation, ranging in maturities from two months to nine years  Dies laesst uns annehmen, dass Enron bestimmte Daten verfuegbar hat.  Nun zum idealen Datensatz:  Forwardoelpreise (am besten WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing) fuer Restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn Jahren fuer den Zeitraum Juli 1986 bis Dezember 1996. Dabei waere eine hohe Datenfrequenz ideal (taeglich, ansonsten woechentlich oder monatlich). Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing nuetzlich.  Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht erfuellen lassen. Jedoch waere uns auch schon geholfen, wenn ein kuerzerer Zeitraum oder eine niedrigere Datenfrequenz vorlaege.  Wir waernen Ihnen sehr dankbar, wenn Sie in Erfahrung bringen koennten, inwiefern solche Daten von Enron zu erhalten sind.  Herzlichen Dank fuer Ihre Muehe und beste Gruesse  Olaf Korn   p.s.

__label__DontSave	MRHV Model (power curve) Dear Vince J Kaminski,  As a Mathematical Trading and Finance MSc student (City University London) I am writing my dissertation on power forward curves.  Since you have participated in the writing of the book Managing Energy Price I was wondering if you could eventually help me. The MRHV model seams to be the best econometric one to model the electricity forward curve.  I understand and know how to work out with the classic Mean Reverting Process, but I dont understand the MRHV (I dont know the discretised form and I cannot even find any paper, or article on it) and how to get rid of the exponent to estimate my parameters (long-run mean, Speed of mean reversion, volatility, exponent, Floor price).

__label__Save	Re: London Research PRC Dale,  Thanks for the update. I fully concur with all the rankings. It seems things are going well with the Research Group in London and this is, to a very large extent, your contribution.  I think that Anjam has improved a lot. I dont think, however, that he can run the group in the future. Steve emerged as a natural leader and has overwhelming support in the organization.  Vince       Dale Surbey 06/15/2000 02:28 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: London Research PRC  Vince,  We had the PRC preranking for RAC and Research in London yesterday.  Heres  how everyone came out:  Steven - Superior:  No controversy here.  Steve received consistently strong  feedback (ranked as either superior or excellent in all categories).  The  only rough spot was teamwork, arising from the friction between Anjam and  himself.   Anjam - Excellent:  Anjam received rankings of Superiors or Excellents in all  categories.  Several reviewers commented that Anjams performance in the  areas of producing results in a timely manner and communication have  improved.  I felt the overall ranking of excellent was justified based on  this feedback, even though in terms of leadership I dont rate him high  enough to run the group here.  Stinsen provided the most insightful comment on Anjams performance:   Technically superior but lets his quest for a leadership position detract  from his overall performance.  On a related topic, Anjam has been taking random days off, typically on short  notice, so I suspect hes interviewing for a new job.  Given his inability to  work with Steven (especially in the future when Stephen heads the group),  this may be the best long-term solution.  Any thoughts?     Ben - Superior:  Another non-controversial ranking.  Ben received  consistently high marks from all the groups he supports, especially in the  area of non-technical skills.  I nominated Ben for promotion to Senior Specialist.  Even though he was  promoted at year end, hes taken on a lot of responsibility training Kirstee  and helping manage the other quant resources in Brians group.  Also, since  Kirstee was hired in at the same level as Ben, a mid-year promotion is  appropriate since hes effectively her supervisor.   Kirstee - Strong:  Only limited feedback in the 2 months shes been here.   High marks for technical/quantitative, strong in the soft skills.  I think  the strong rating is the right message for early in the game - gives her a  target for improvement for the rest of the year.   - Dale Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com enron.com Dale Surbey dale.surbey@enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com

He expressed that the Wessex people had originated the data and  that the graph was correct, to the best of their knowledge.  The only (but  very important correction) is that they started the graph at an index of  100%, which does not imply a 100% of RAB multiple.  Rather, the initial RAB  multiple was around 80%, implying that the entire line should be taken down  by 20 percentile points.

__label__Save	Re: Emission trading Vince,   I spoke with Susan Wood, who heads up our emissions marketing effort who  says we dont really have any materials we send out. She did recommend the  Emissions trading handbook which can be purchased for $50 from  http://www.etei.org/handbook_changed.htm.    In general, the site http://www.etei.org/ is a great source of info, and the  the parent site, http://www.emissions.org should be checked out as well.

__label__DontSave	Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.  Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.  Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation.   Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.  Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Companys related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enrons accounting for these transactions.  You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.  You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.

__label__Save	New basis report Bhavna:  The basis report has been updated to cover 2000 prices. It is called  Basisnw7.xls and is in the ERG database. It looks to be working correctly, but of course without data it is a little  hard to confirm.  As always, it is ultimately your job to verify that the  numbers reported are correct.  Lemme know if there are problems.    It is easy to change the spreadsheet to start a new year.  You should keep  this mail message as a reference. 1)  Add 12 to the expression in PrintMacro!B35 i.e. change  COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+63,i,12,1)) to  COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+75,i,12,1))  2) Define a new cell reference on the basis page for the first date to be  printed out on the report page.  For example, last year, the basis report  went from Jan 93 to Dec 1999. In Basisnw6.xls there is a name Jan93 defined  as Basis!A64 (i.e. refers to the row where the Jan 1993 basis numbers are  recorded).  This year, in Basisnw7.xls, I defined  Jan94 to refer to  Basis!A76.  Thats because the basis report will now run from Jan 1994 to  Dec 2000.  3)  Change the expression in PrintMacro!B45 to use this new cell reference  i.e.  change COPY(OFFSET(Jan93,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1)) to  COPY(OFFSET(Jan94,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1))  4) Having executed steps 1) - 3) the spreadsheet will now print numbers  shifted up by one year.  All that remains to do is to change the dates on the  PrintFormat page to be one year more.  By that I mean change 1998 to 1999,  1999 to 2000, change 98/99 to 99/00, etc.  Dont move any numbers or formulas!   Thats it.  As we discussed Bhavna, while I am happy to do this for you, it  is not in your or my best interest for this to continue.  Please do work to  find some one in your shop to maintain this spreadsheet.   Regards, and Happy New Year! Grant. Grant Masson grant.masson@enron.com enron.com Bhavna Pandya bhavna.pandya@enron.com 
__label__Save	Indication Dates for Sharads Visit Hi Vince,  Having discussed with Sharad, we think it would make sense for Sharad to go  to Houston for a few weeks starting at the end of October.  This would  overlap with Bens visit in November and so some alternative arrangement  would have to be made for accommodation.  If he goes after Ben then there  will not be much time before the holidays meaning it would be left until  early next year.  Please let us know if these dates work for you, and if so  then we can talk about accommodation arrangements thereafter.

__label__DontSave	request Hello Vince--- Have a request for you. Were preparing our Annual End of Ye= ar Issue this week and wanted to ask for your participation. The issue is a=  sort of combo issue merging all of our publications (The Desk, The Risk De= sk, New Power Exec and The Bandwidth Desk), and takes a look at trends, rev= iew of the year in about 20 categories (tech, policy, VC stuff, market tren= ds, credit, strategies, risk, book reviews, weather) and of course a look a= head. Most of the submitted pieces we run are in the form of commentaries o= n specific topics -- were trying to stay away from the usual broad, mushy = stuff you read about this time of the year -- translation, were looking fo= r a detailed view of things -- open with a short take on key bits that occu= rred this year, how it may have altered the course of the market or a parti= cular sector (why or why not with details) and finally whats ahead. The ge= neral formula works well weve found; we expect the issue to be at least 40=  pages this year. Im sure you remember the drill from last year. Anyhow, b= ack to you. What Im looking for is this -- the fall of the Big E has certa= inly put more focus on better risk management -- great, but what does that = really mean? Consider some of the commentaries or interviews youre run in = the past on the strategy/tactics side, and rethink the juicy bits. What hav= e we (the traded markets, or retail for that matter) not yeat fully learned=  or embraced? Do you think next year will see an altogether different power=  market? Why or why not. Specific changes in your space? Each year for the = past 5 years, there has been one big event that has seemingly changed the w= ay we do or think about things. What will this year mean to 2002? Whether i= n terms of systems, credit, ops, venture investment, risk management, marke= ting, managing the book, whatever. The key in this, is detail and specifics= . Whats it going to take to get people to play smarter? Need about 1000 wo= rds (more or less, your call), which you can probably do over cheerios in t= he morning. The deadline is Dec. 18. Well be spinning out the issue to abo= ut 5,000 people, so the exposure should be very good for you--well include=  contact names and numbers etc. If this is doable, please let me know asap.=  Otherwise, hope you and the fam is well, hey -- dont be such a stranger f= or Gods sake. Again, Dec. 18 deadline.

In this  reference, could you (Stinson) get this from either Heather Mitchell, or John  Viverito (who is the lawyer involved with Japan, reporting to Alan  Aronowitz).

I was not  able to download my messages in time for the calls, but I will be on going  forward.  While I am still on vacation, I have been in conversation with Vince and the  Research Group following up on the Henwood study we had spoken about.  We  have received a formal proposal from Henwood, and they are wanting  authorization to go forward.  The study will get us the despatch forecasts  for the next 8-10 years, and will deliver the results by January end, per  Henwood.  Vince and I have reviewed the proposal, and feel that we should proceed.  We  will be fine tuning the assignment as we go forward.  The big issue there is  the data for the model/s, and at this point Henwood is relying more on us to  provide the data.  We spoke to Henwood yesterday, and I will be on another  call with them on Friday.  I need your confirmation on the following:  That I have your approval to proceed ahead with the study  That the study shall be paid for by DPC, and if so, is it OK for me to sign  the authorization being sent by Henwood We will need a formal confidentiality agreement to be in place by tomorrow  (Jim - if you have a particular format, please let me know) I am leaving the issue of hourly rates and cost to the Research group since  they have more experience in dealing with groups like Henwood.  They feel the  costs are reasonable, and I will leave it at that.  We will need to collect data from the different sources we have in India, and  I have proposed that there be a formal session in India between Henwood and  the ENE team in India in the week between 10th and 15th.  This is important  to insure that there are no disconnects, and that there are no illusions on  the quality of the data that will be available.  It will also help us  formalize the scope and better define the issues.  In order to meet the  deadlines, the data will have to be in place by January 15th.  I will call Jim later today (I had called but you were on a call).  I am here  till the weekend when I leave for India.  Please let me know if this  arrangement is OK.  Regards, Sandeep.

I am sure Bjorn will be looking to the Research Group to assist  in this matter. iii) ensure that MG staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our  methods and systems and vice versa  These tasks will involve a significant degree of cross-communication with  relevant contacts within MG metals, and so I look forward to starting on the  process as soon as possible - I hope to play a full part from a quantitative  research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes  smoothly in this exciting new development, so please do not hesitate to  involve me.

__label__DontSave	Organizational Announcement As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.  Organizational Matters The Creditors Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.  From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.  By now, you must have heard of NETCO. This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enrons most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.  As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.  Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.  Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditors Committee.  Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.  Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enrons various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enrons reorganization plan and value preservation.  Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enrons reorganization plan.  Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:  Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman  Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.  We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyones patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

__label__Save	PPI Index Short-Term Models Hi Martina & Trena,  I made a few minor changes to the models...  I reckon these models can be  checked in Houston now - the raw data is included (see attached spreadsheets)  and all the regression parameters and main statistics are displayed.  I  became interested in how far DZCV and PLLU should be below RPI and whether  this model is reflecting any reversion to the RPI level; I believe that the  forecasts are accurately reflecting this.  Please see graphs below:    Both models really need our RPI curve to be linked (at the moment I have just  copied the 2.3% number forward).  Because the auto-regressive error term is  not very important, we can run the models forward with reasonable  confidence.  As I mentioned, I dont think we can really run this model more  than 12 months, in fact, I think we should run for 9-12 months and blend the  next 3-4 months out with the long-term model.  Hope I can fix the long-term ones now with some new insight!

__label__Save	Changes in option valuation in Enpower ---------------------- Forwarded by Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT on 03/21/2001 08:33 AM  --------------------------- From: Harry Arora/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/21/2001 07:26 AM To: Sanjay Gupta/ENRON@enronXgate, Steve Nat/ENRON@enronXgate cc: Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Changes in option valuation in Enpower  Sanjay  Wanted to confirm the changes to the option valuations in the Enpower we  discussed yesterday evening.  1. Currently the trader volatility inputs are the daily vol curve and the  intra-monthly vol curve. The monthly options get marked directly to the  monthly curve (plus the smile) and the monthlies get marked to a time blend  of monthly and intra-month vol (plus the skew).  We want to change the valuation (for the Eastern books) so that the dailies  get marked to the intramonth curve (which we want to call the daily curve)  and the monthly gets marked to the monthly curved. There will be not vol  blending done by the Enpower system for the daily and monthly option  valuations. We want to make this change very soon (by early next week)   2. Currently there exists one smile for every region, which is specified in  terms of volatility additive  for specified dollar difference from the  underlying. Since different months in a region can trade in a large range  ($35 - $150) - this cannot result in accurate skew for all terms.  What we  need is a system which has skew per month.  We suggest, for the short term, the skew should apply only to the summer  daily expiration options. We need to make this change by early next week.  However, we need to start modifing  the system so that for every region we  can enter a grid which has a percentage scale and specifies the skew  differently for each month.  Research, has implemented this in our pricing  model, and we would like this grid to be input into the valuation system.  I  am enclosing the pricing model (which we both discussed yesterday) for  reference. This model is however, work under construction, so pls call Alex  Huang for clarifications.  3. The vol input system is complex and confusing. I would very much be interested in moving to a direct database interface,  which accomodates the skew inputs per region as in <2>. We should implement a  UI which can input the dailies and monthlies at the moneys and the skew grid  directly - so that we do not need to go through multiple iterations. I am very much interested in what we currently are releasing in Delphi and  would love an early implementation for options.  On all these issues, I am speaking for the East desk. I am going to touch  base with West guys and see if they are on board with these changes.

__label__Save	Re: Synfuel option valuation Lenny,  I believe that you must have done your home work on the the tax credit  issue.  However, it may make sense to create some kind of reserve in case the tax credit is removed  in the future.   I am glad that you like the way we treat the tax credit, which is built into  the strike price for the digital option. With the tax credit,  it is most likely the option will be  exercised.  Paulo  Issler is the person who worked on this model initially. He will be  back this Wednesday. We can talk to him about the standard deviation he put into the model.   Zimin        Lenny Hochschild@ENRON 02/12/2001 08:15 AM To: Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: Synfuel option valuation    Zimin,   Thanks for your e-mail.  Sorry for the late reply, I was travelling last week. Im under the impression that the with the new administration, there is a  greater chance that Section 29 will be extended beyond 2007 than repealed. If  this happens, we contractually have the right to extend this contract. We  have not valued the chance of this happening, so I dont think we should  value the chance of this not happening.  Anyways, let me speak to my supervisor on this and revert.  In the meantime, I looked over the amendment you made with regard to adding  the second strike of the tax credit and think this is now reflective of the  deal and am happy with it. I still do not understand a few things re:  where  did the St. deviations come from. I believe you said that someone who works  for you put this together but was away last week.  Please revert with his/her name so that I can get together and understand  this.  Thanks.

One thing, I think you are prefectly aware of it, is that the economics of this deal is driven by the tax credit ($25.03).  The risk on our side is that if the tax credit is removed, AIG will not deliver the synfuel   and pay $4.55 to us.    Vince mentioned that Congress might act  quickly enough to eliminate  the tax benefit.   I just want to remind you we should take this risk  into consideration.

In this regard, I have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research and the Institute for Computational Finance at the UT Austin. Right now I am also in the process of forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be interested in receiving this preprint. Please let me know if you might be interested in receiving this preprint.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Sincerely yours,  Valery Kholodnyi Manager of Quantitative Analysis Research and Analytics Group TXU Energy Trading  PS. Here are the main preprints that I have recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power:  1. Valery A. Kholodnyi, The Stochastic Process for Power Prices with Spikes  and Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power, Preprint, TXU-RAG-01/00,  July 2000. 2. Valery A. Khlolodnyi, Valuation of a Swing Option on Power with Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-05/00, August, 2000. 3. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Spark Spread Option on Power with  Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-21/00, November 2000. 4. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power at  Two Distinct Points on the Grid with Spikes in Both Power Prices, Preprint TXU-RAG-24/00, November 2000. 5. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Transmission Option on Power with  Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-25/00, November 2000.  As I have indicated to you in my previous e-mail, contrary to the standard approaches, I model spikes directly, as self-reversing jumps on top of a stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of spikes. In this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non-Markovian process, even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is Markovian. Among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes, provided that the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the absence of spikes.

__label__Save	UK Inflation and Storage model Hi Zimin,  INFLATION: I am also spending a lot of time looking at short-term auto-regressive models  for PPI and long-term, more fundamentally-based models.  This work is  important because we have potentially a large positive P&L that may be  unlocked by moving to our new indicative UK PPI curves.  John Sherriff and  Trena are keen that any models I produce are vetted/approved in Houston, so I  will forward to Stinson or yourself initially for review once ready and  documented.  STORAGE: Thanks for the current storage  model.

__label__DontSave	resume of Torpong Cheevaprawatdomrong Vince and Stinson,  I talked with Torpong, the friend of mine that I mentioned this morning. His original plan is to take MBA classes in the fall and go back to work for his fathers company. But he has a very good impression of Enrons image and if he can gain work experiences at Enron, it would be the best. He is interested to work for Enron, at least for 1-2 years, before going back to work for his fathers company. I am sure that he is a smart person and can learn things really fast. Attached are his resume and transcript. I think we should telephone interview him.

IBMs new servers will support Linux on up to 16 processors in a 3U (three rack unit) sized box. The first versions of the xSeries will include 32-bit Intel processors, with 64-bit chips to come later.  An interesting feature that could be useful to server administrators is the ability to partition processors on the xSeries servers. With this, users could set up a Linux server to do multiple tasks in a single box, such as assigning different bunches of processors to handle Web, database, e- mail, or file and print serving. Different Linux distributions could be run on the partitioned processor groups, or even other operating systems, such as Windows-based systems.  The new IBM servers support several hardware enhancements aimed at making Linux systems more reliable. The xSeries will include what IBM calls Active PCI-X, which allows a server technician to replace PCI or PCI-X adapters or peripherals on the fly, without having to power down the server. A memory mirroring feature is also included, which can help avoid crashes due to corrupted memory. Mirroring allows a server to detect when a RAM module goes bad and replicate the system memory from hard disk space, allowing for the bad RAM to be replaced without shutting down the server.  Next issue, well look at how Dell is keeping pace with its own Linux server offerings.   _______________________________________________________________ To contact Phil Hochmuth:  Phil Hochmuth is a staff writer for Network World, and a former systems integrator.

__label__DontSave	New CERA Study - New Realities/New Risks: North American Power & Gas 2020 Mr. Vincent J. Kaminski Managing Director Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  Dear Mr. Kaminski:  Powerful new forces are transforming the North American gas and power industry, bringing considerable volatility and uncertainty to investment and strategy. Questions relating to prices, security, geopolitics, the global economy, and environmental concerns are forcing reconsideration of basic assumptions and plans.  To address these questions and concerns, Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) announces a timely new multiclient study, New Realities, New Risks: North American Power and Gas 2020.  In an online interview CERA Senior Director Lawrence J. Makovich presents a brief overview of major issues to be addressed in the study. To hear more information about the study, please access the interview on our website at http://www.cera.com/mc?c=2804&p=1044 .  Using CERAs scenario planning methodology, New Realities, New Risks will present plausible alternate paths to the future of power and gas markets in North America over the next 20 years. The Study will provide useful tools for evaluating corporate strategies and investments as well as an integrated assessment of gas and power market analyses.  The study will address key issues including *What levels of gas and power prices are sustainable? *How will the current wave of power plant and gas pipeline infrastructure development shift North American energy dynamics? *What opportunities, risks and challenges face those involved in the industry? *How will technological developments affect future gas and power markets? *Will the role of government expand or contract in the energy industry? *What will be the cost and value of increased energy security? *Who will be the winners and losers in each scenario?  For complete details of the study, including deliverables and proposed study content, please visit our website at http://www.cera.com/offerings/details/1,1504,CID2299,00.html.  In the traditional CERA format, the study will start with a kick-off workshop. Exclusively hosted for study participants(*), the kick-off workshop will take place in early January at a location to be announced.   To obtain your confidential study prospectus, please contact Noelle Hernandez-Bullrich at nhernandez@cera.com or via phone at +1 617 498 9148. You may also contact Ron Kapavik at rkapavik@cera.com or via phone at +1 617 441 2629 with any specific questions you have about the study.  Thank you for your consideration, and we look forward to your participation in this study.

__label__DontSave	 Vince,    I agree with you that its a lesson people need to learn over and over again.  I cant tell you how many politicians I met over the past year who really dont like markets and certainly dont understand how or why they work.  These arent just the minor leaguers in Sacramento, but the big league players in Washington.    I also agree that the academic community can play an important role in shaping public opinion and in explaining the logic of deregulation process.  Id like to think that is in large part what I have been trying to do.  Frank Frank A.

__label__DontSave	RE: Feedback from Iris in London Hi Vasant,   How are you?  Sorry to hear that you are getting swamped with work.   I am doing my best to spend time with the Enron Credit team to learn about  their current (public firm) models.  In addition, I have begun to review  various econometrics approaches that may be applicable to the private firm  models (PCA, PLS, Cluster analysis, etc.).  Also, at the suggestion of Vince  and Slava, I am trying to work on the overall strategic plan (aka the  Duffie document).   Amitava suggested that we might want to have a conference call on Tuesday  with Bryan, Markus and Vince to get an update on their ever changing strategy  and data needs.  Amitava said that he would ask Anita to coordinate this  conference call.   Let me know if there is anything else you would like for me to do while I am  here.  Take care, Iris Iris Mack iris.mack@enron.com enron.com Vasant Shanbhogue vasant.shanbhogue@enron.com Amitava Dhar amitava.dhar@enron.com  Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com

Ill try to dig up some specific articles, but I suspect most of them are in  one way or another CME  press releases so that they will gloss over the low liquidity.

It is always my honor to work with you. I am currently a PhD student at the mathsmatics department of the university of Queensland (aiming to finish my thesis at the end of this year). My research interest is financial mathematics, in particular, energy market modeling and derivatives pricing. Now I send you copies of my first paper (submitted to the Applied mathematical finance) and my talk (the full version of the academic paper will be available in 2 weeks). Any comment will be appreciated.  PS: attached with the talk at the conference.

In addition I belive that she has forwarded to you my CV.          My communication with Ms. Szablya has been less than satisfactory for some time. Therefore Ms. Szablya is nolonger representing me and I would like Ms. Rita de Claris (whom I cc) of De Claris & Associates (713 - 868 - 4440) to represent me in the future in this search. I have instructed her to forward my CV to you once more.          Forgive me for this, perhaps unusual, step but I regard highly the opportunity of working at ENRON and do not feel I am being adequately represented at present.          I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Please find attached the RPI model I developed by bootstrapping RPI swaps.  The structure of this particular swap is:    semi/semi Act/365F > > YOYUKRPI = (UKRPI(p-2)/UKRPI(p-14) - 1)/2 > p = payment month > The first payment is the latest known historical RPI, February 2000. You will  notice that I have assumed constant cashflows between the quoted years (as  opposed to interpolating swaps which distorts the curve a lot).  Please find below a graphic comparison between the RPI curve produced by  swaps and the one produced by the GILT market.    Looking forward to your comments.

I reckon these models can be  checked in Houston now - the raw data is included (see attached spreadsheets)  and all the regression parameters and main statistics are displayed.  I  became interested in how far DZCV and PLLU should be below RPI and whether  this model is reflecting any reversion to the RPI level; I believe that the  forecasts are accurately reflecting this.  Please see graphs below:    Both models really need our RPI curve to be linked (at the moment I have just  copied the 2.3% number forward).  Because the auto-regressive error term is  not very important, we can run the models forward with reasonable  confidence.  As I mentioned, I dont think we can really run this model more  than 12 months, in fact, I think we should run for 9-12 months and blend the  next 3-4 months out with the long-term model.  Hope I can fix the long-term ones now with some new insight!

__label__Save	Re: Enron/Stanford Program Hi Vince, Stinson  Thank you for hosting my visit to Enron and arranging for me to meet with you and other decision-makers at Enron. The meetings been very productive on my side, as I try to formulate the project more clearly.  We are entering the period that I have to set up the Research Assistantships  (RA) for next year for Giuseppe and the other student I have committed to support on this project. School starts in late September, but already I have to start putting together the papers for the RAs in the Fall, as per departmental requirement.  Would it be possible to put the project in place soon, so that I can do the RAship papers for the students? I expect I will start having pressure from the department to do the paperwork for these RAships early September, and I have to have them in place by the third week of September, just before school starts.  I am attaching below the same DRAFT of a letter I had sent you in a previous e-mail, which would be required to set up the project at Stanford. Please, let me know how you would like to proceed.  Again, thanks for your hospitality and I look forward to productive  collaboration during the coming year and beyond.  Best Regards,  Nick   PS: Vince, I look forward to seeing you during your visit to the Bay Area in October.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DRAFT of letter to be sent from Enron to Stanford.   Prof. Nicholas Bambos 420 Terman Engineering Center Management Science & Eng. Dept. and Electrical Engineering Department Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305   Dear Nick,  We are happy to provide gift funds of $100,000 per year, over three years, to support a program in your research group, related to Bandwidth Markets/Trading and Networking Technologies.  Enron would like to support research activities in the above mentioned area, including Pd.D. student work, research seminars etc. There may also be opportunities to have the supported Ph.D. students do summer internships at Enron, related to their research interests.  Please find enclosed a check of $100,000 payable to Stanford University for supporting this research effort in your group during the first year.

__label__Save	eol trade size discrepancies Vince-  I have discovered the two sources of discrepancy in the transaction dollars  on EOL, between my numbers and those of EOL. First, EOL records all index  trades with the Henry Hub price (since the index price isnt, inadvertently,  recorded with the trade, as I told you), whereas I went back and appended the  contemporaneous index price to the trades. Second, EOL ignores all Basis  trades in reporting transaction dollars, whereas I append a rough size to  them of the price as the basis, times the quantity.  Im sorry I wasnt ready in time with my numbers; I took the task of accuracy  very seriously.

__label__Save	A applicable model Kim,    After yestersdays meeting, Ive come up with an idea which is applicable to  the zone EF and seems also to be applicable to the broader area. The model assumes that if  there are positive spreads of energy products between pairs of locations, we can always find the possibilities of  swaptions. This assumption, as  discussed with Jim and Sean, is a reasonable approximation. I suggest that  the prototype be built up at this model if you think that it is rational.  If you interested in the model, I  will explain it to all of you.

__label__DontSave	MSCF Advisory Board Membership Vince,  I am pleased to hear you will be returning to MSCF this year, participating in the Speaker Series on December 7.   Enron has a tremendous reputation in quantitative finance circles and your obvious interest in our students is deeply appreciated.  I know, too, our students are very much looking forward to your visit.  On a separate but definitely related matter, would you consider serving on our Advisory Board?   You will note our present membership (http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/advisory.html) reflects no representation from an energy firm.  I speak on behalf of the MSCF Steering Committee in expressing our hope that you would be willing to correct this!  The Advisory Board meets once a year, usually in the late fall in New York. Its six (or so) members serve for a three year term.  Enrons participation on the MSCF Board would allow you to influence the direction of the program to the advantage of the energy companies and give you access to a first look at the MSCF Resume Book.  From our standpoint, your experience and counsel would be of tremendous benefit to us as we consider challenges and opportunities in the MSCF program in the years ahead.  Our 2001 meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, Dec. 12 in mid-town Manhattan. Would you be willing join us?  Rick  Mr. Richard L.

__label__Save	Exotica (yet again) Hi guys  I need some advice.  Sharad is in the process of finding differences between your and our versions  of Exotica.  At some point we will need to migrate London office over to your  more up-to-date version, and Im concerned that there may be RAC-style  implications.  Im in favour of using the IT testers to carry out formal  regression testing, and they are apparently able to do this.  Do we need to get our heads together to form a view before we involve RAC  or the business groups?  Anjam tells Sharad that London Exotica was built using Excel 95, and that  neither he nor Zimin knows how to build/compile the XLA using later versions  of Excel.  Is this true?  If so, then we need to migrate to XLLs sooner  rather than later because of the maintenance implications.

As promised, I am enclosing our executive summary and first chapter from our business plan for you to take forward to your management as a prospective Enron-MarketPoint investment collaboration.  I want to reiterate that should Enron elect to be the lead investor here, you will be exclusive in your industry if you want.  If Enron wants to be the lead and ensure the entire second round of resources we need, we would not offer and investment opportunity to other trading companies, pipelines, or electrics until the third or subsequent rounds and then only with your participation as a MarketPoint board member.  I am aware you have coinvested with SAP in the past and that you might want to coinvest with them again.  I presume you would not have a problem with non-competitors such as EPRI, our management consulting service provider partner, or our VC partner (but I would want guidance from you in this arena).  I think you would find our VC partner very suitable and very attractive.  They have done several interesting energy and trading plays, and they would provide good management skills I believe.  I hope we can move forward together.  I am looking forward to a positive response.  Thanks again and best regards.  Dale Nesbitt  PS:  You might hear from Drew Ries of your Investments group.

__label__Save	Re: LNG May 19 decision John,  This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.  1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH  and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the  decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island  project (please, see point 2).  2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest  (Sally Becks organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island  transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enrons LNG-related  positions   in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is  meeting to close a few remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.  A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:  a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island  facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.  The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are  setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and  coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.  b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension  option of 5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for  such a long tenor. This is   essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread  and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.  One solution would be to  cover, lets say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the  first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.  c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a  big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market.  d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island  deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions. Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail  that  correlates very well with Brent.   Vince     John Sherriff 05/14/2000 01:40 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: LNG May 19 decision   Vince  I havent spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.

Vince         Rodrigo Lamas 08/24/2000 11:01 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Introduction meeting : RAC London Quants and Houston Research   Vince,  I work for the Market Risk RAC London group. I review the quantitative issues  arising from Enron Europe models. I am in this function given my background (PhD from Imperial College-London)  and also due to my past experience as risk manager for a brazilian investment bank and Louis Dreyfus.  My agenda includes the review of a number of deals (Wessex, TPL, Eastern,  ...), as well as the  review of the construction of european gas and power price curves and their  respective volatility curves. Currently I am devoting most of my time to the analysis of the UK gas market,  its respective price curve and term structure of volatility.  Bjorn and David suggested it could be very productive if I had the chance to  meet you and your team to discuss issues related to modelling prices and risk measurement tools.   I will be in Houston from the 10th to 15th September. I wonder if you could  book some time for me in your agenda and also ask some members of your team to do the same.

__label__Save	eol stuff Vince-  I spoke with Tom, and I completely agree and would like to hand all this EOL  stuff over to you.  We need a Sun server to take over the task. As it happens Martin Lin has one  in his office hes not using and up to the task. His box could serve SAS to  Enron, as well as handle listening in on the EOL feedds and maintaining its  database.  Martins box technically belongs to EBS, but I think they are downsizing and  wouldnt mind giving it up.  In this way, you would have complete physical and administrative custody over  the data and any work you do with it. I neednt be involved, and you can know  your work is completely confidential.  Ill make SAS and the EOL software available, as well as the necessary RAM  the server, at no charge. You just need to summon up some SysAdmin resources  to finish the job. There is a fine Unix guy named Ben Thompson who will  support you, Im sure.  Task:  1) Upgrade RAM on Martins server 2) Install newest Solaris OS on server 3) Install Tibco and GNU software on server 4) Install SAS on server  Clayton Clayton Vernon clayton.vernon@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com

__label__Save	Seasonal factors and curve fitting I have written a C++ code to do the following: For a given curve, the code will filter out the seasonal factor.  It then fits the deseasoned curve to a smooth function of the form  f(t)=a+A/(t+B)c, with 0<c<.5. ?The curve fitting is achieved by using Conjugate Gradient method. ??As Tanya pointed out, this form of function ensures that  ?f(t)2*t - f(t-1)2*(t-1) >0, which is useful in calculating forward-forward ?vol. ?The outputs are season patterns (2 different patterns are allowed)?and the smoothed curve.  One can then calculate forward-forward vol?from the smoothed curve and superimpose the seasonal factors back?onto the curve.??This procedure is not useful for VaR calcuation. However, I believe it ?is useful for other situations which require the knowledge of  seasonal ?forward-forward vols.  For example, in power plant valuation and?credit exposure simulations, it would reflect the reality more closely?if we add seasonality to our forward-forward vol in simulating the forward?prices. ??Attached are the spreadsheet and XLL file.

__label__DontSave	RE: longitude Thank you, Joe. If they include combinatorial bids then it would be a much more complicated system. I think everything comes down to liquidity. If they have enough volume, then it will attract even more bidders because the bidders do not have to think too much about the fair price because they will always get the lowest successful price anyway. If there is small volume, then it will become harder for the bidders to decide on optimal bidding strategy. Personally I think this system will work because there are many speculators out there who want to play this kind of games.  :-)  -Chonawee   -----Original Message----- From:  Hrgovcic, Joseph   Sent: Saturday, November 03, 2001 4:33 PM To: Supatgiat, Chonawee; Bharati, Rakesh; Shanbhogue, Vasant; Kaminski, Vince J Subject: RE: longitude  Chonawee,   Good work. Id like to add a few observations. Regarding your comment about not being able to buy straddles:  Longitude informed us that an upcoming implementation (that is actually in place now but has not been made available so as not to complicate the initial auctions). The new implementation allows packages of digital spreads to be bought and sold as one instrument, resulting in terraced payout functions that approximate true call and put (and presumably collar and straddle) payouts. Even so, the structures will remain largely digital in nature; therefore, they will be rather dirty hedges for traditional calls and puts regardless of how one packages them   As far as getting a bad price, the auctions here are indeed Dutch auctions, but I believe that the limit orders address this issue -- they assure a given payout ratio. Certainly there is no guarantee that any of the amount laid down by a participant will be placed, which is another problem for hedgers. (Then again, a traditional hedger who asks too much for his offsetting transaction is also unlikely to meet with success.)   Lastly, with regard to the last paragraph on publishing tentative prices, it is left up to to the discretion of market maker to decide how much of the auctions internal operations (including tentative prices) is posted, but remember that the auction is intended to last only a few hours at a time, yet again constraining the auctions suitability for hedging (admittedly, there would likely be several auctions throughout the life-cycle of the underlying index).

__label__DontSave	Cash needs Vince,  I was thinking that max (negative)  potential exposure for different counterparties could occur for different scenarios and so combining max potential exposure across counterparties may overstate cash needs.  If overall scenario for overall max (negative) potential exposure is considered, then we will pick up some high exposures and some low exposures, which may be fine.  Alternately, why not tweak the potential exposure program to do deterministic shifts of one sigma and two sigma and assuming one factor model and perfect correlation across commodities. Then the negative mtm values can be compared to collateral already outstanding. This method does not guarantee that we will get large exposures, but is easy to explain.  Another thing to check with Winston is that the program does not automatically zero out negative exposures. If it does, then we may have to flip the sign for all positions, get the exposures, then flip back the sign. Then compare to collateral outstanding.

__label__Save	California Update 1/31/01 Please do not hesitate to contact Robert Johnston (x39934) or Kristin Walsh  (x39510) with additional questions.  Executive Summary An announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of  long-term contracts (price and term). The threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as Davis hatches a plan  to 1) pass on court ordered rate increases and 2) issue revenue bonds. Audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred  to parent companies.  Davis is expected to use the threat of endless  appeals in courts and a possible ballot initiative in November to keep the  pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt, as well  as to limit the scope of the rate hikes. Davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him  with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to California  consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy. Davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups.  If there is a  ballot initiative in November to challenge the expected court-ordered rate  hikes, it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state.  Legislation and Bail Out Bill AB1X was heard for several hours in the Senate Appropriations  yesterday.  Issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure,  specifically for communities that have harsh climates.  However, the bill has  received support from almost everyone including consumer groups.   The bill  is expected to pass sometime today.  Tim Gage, CA Director of Finance said  Davis supports all the provisions in AB1X and expected to sign.    Bill AB18X was not heard in the Assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear  today.  In committee hearings Monday, the DWR testified it is spent all of  the $400M and were spending $45M/day in the spot market to buy power.  According to sources with direct access to Governor Davis, the on-going court  battle, as discussed below, is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a  settlement.  Davis recognizes that 1) the expected court ruling in the CPUC  case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to  California rate payers; 2) despite that ruling, the state government has the  ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the  two utilities unless they come to terms.  Thus, Davis believes that  California consumers cannot avoid getting  hit with higher electricity  charges, but he plans to use the threat of an appeal (and a possible ballot  initiative) to limit the amount of the rate hikes.    A plan to exempt the lowest income, smallest consumers from any rate increase  and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130% of a baseline  usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in Sacramento.  That would  still hit about one half of all consumers (since the baseline is set at 60%  of average consumption), but it is progressive in a politically important  sense.   Making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night  when PG&E admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many  customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates.    The companys defense (they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash) was  met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation  policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious  efforts by Californians to use less electricity.   Every time you think  theres a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves,  something like this happens, one legislator moaned.  Long-Term Contracts  A second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the  negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long-term power buying  contracts Davis initiated earlier this month.  The first wave of those  contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be  surprisingly positive, according to officials in the talks.  We got a series  of good offers in those initial proposals.   And some not so good ones, one  official told our source.   The idea is to announce the results of the first  contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say,  you want in on this with these terms?   We think well eventually shake  loose a lot of supply with this strategy.  Bankruptcy  Because of these new dynamics, there is improved market confidence that  California will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for  SoCal Edison and PG&E, even as they are set to miss another round of payments  to creditors and suppliers today (remember, there is a standstill agreement  among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until Feb. 13).  We believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost  by the court case in front of US District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew in Los  Angeles, which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for  elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week, at  the latest.  In fact, without that political cover it would be impossible to  square all the various circles of this crisis.   Audit Results and Ballot Initiatives Markets, Bush administration officials, and perhaps utility companies  themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will  launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200l to bring all  electricity generation back under state control.  The threat of a proposition  initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the  California Public Utilities Commission released in the last 48 hours  confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since  mid-January.  First, the audit of SoCal Edison confirmed that $2 billion of  the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to  itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells  power.  Second, it confirmed that Edison electric paid nearly $5 billion in  profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its  stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even  while it was going on a debt-issuing binge.   The audit of PG&E released late last night was even more damaging: PG&E  management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to  clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis by not making deep  spending cuts, including scaling back management salaries.  The auditors  also questioned the utilitys decision to funnel some $4.7 billion of its  profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company,  which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks.   Basically, they took the money and ran, as State Senate Speaker Burton put  it yesterday.  What appears to be Governor Gray Davis grudging acceptance of reality is  actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough  rate hikes/taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without  triggering a new -- and far more damaging -- burst of populist outrage among  a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making  this all up.  There is no doubt that this use of money by SoCal Edison and  the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the  spirit of the 1996 deregulation law, but that is irrelevant in popular  political terms.  Were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by  the court case discussed below, these audits would make settlement extremely  difficult.  Keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key  to understanding the very complex game that Davis, his advisers and senior  legislators are now playing.   A ballot initiative would be a potential  disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re-establishing full  public control over the electric utilities.  Even if the state and utilities  successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before  that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during  that prolonged period.   Thats something California cannot afford as  businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate.   Court Battle Thus, legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of  the court case in Los Angeles that SoCal Edison and PG&E are likely to win in  mid-February.  The court will most likely grant the two utilities $12.7  billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders  of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30%, California politicians  could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start  of this extended drama: political cover. Davis will then have to rely on his  political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the  utilities to pass on something less than the full $12.7 billion debt.  PG&E and SoCal Edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed  to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they  have accumulated since August last year when the PUC refused to let them  raise prices even as electricity prices soared.  The court said the 1996  deregulation law was crystal clear -- when the two utilities had repaid  so-called stranded costs, they were free to begin charging whatever they  needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power.   Although the utilities won this case, the Judge stayed his order until  February 14th at the state governments request.  As that deadline  approaches, an intense new negotiating round is under way.  On the one hand,  political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher  electric prices (the courts made me do it), but on the other hand, they  also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would  force electricity rates up by about 40% on top of natural gas bills that have  soared by about 300% since last year.  Utility companies are playing this  card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final  bailout.  Well just wait until the court puts the order into effect in  mid-February then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and  easily.  One tactic the state political officials are using, in order to force a  settlement, is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the  next couple of years.  One political official pointed out that they could  keep the utilities from receiving their money this year, next year or perhaps  even the year after. Sure, we tell them, they will probably win in court and  get that money.  Eventually.  We are making them well aware that unless we  have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the Supreme  Court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least.  We dont think  the creditors will be quite that patient.

__label__DontSave	RE: Scotts concerns about the Public Firm Models Hi Scott,   I stand to be corrected.  I forgot that the recording of dates in the UK is different from the way it is recorded in the US.  The date on Geoges document is 04/10/00, i.e., October 4, 2000.     Again, Jeff stated that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to sort out the public firm model issues.  Until then, I am busy trying to develop the private firm model - which is the deliverable we promised to Enron Credit (as stated in the Elaboration Document I sent last week).

The meeting summary addresses testing only briefly in saying be aware of the time dimension which is obvious and has been addressed by adding more equity driven ratios as well as our plan to add a time dimension to capture ratings momentum following a downgrade.      Perhaps you didnt understand my specific request for any ideas you might have to assist in model testing and also for an update on the Duffie report.  We still have not seen any drafts of what you learned.  As Im sure you recall, the teleconference with Vince, Vasant, and Amitava focused exclusively on private firm models, the scope of the project, and data acquisition considerations.  After the call, you suggested to Bryan, Eric, Mike and I that your report would include many of the issues in Georges 2 documents (movement model and meeting summary).  My personal hope, echoed by Bryan at that time, was that your report might be more insightful since the movement model, as you surely learned in your visit, is in its infancy and only one portion of the modelling effort and the meeting summary covered the most basic issues with minimal detail.      I sincerely want to establish a solid relationship with Houston Research and hope we can move forward together in a coordinated, team-oriented approach.  I look forward to discussing it with you at our Tuesday teleconference.  Best regards, Scott  FYI - George joined the company in Sep 2000 so could not have written the Movement Model proposal in April 2000.

Thanks for your email.   I can appreciate your concerns about the public firm models, but am at a loss for what more I can say that has not already been said.    Recall that during my recent trip to London, we had a conference call with Houston research, you, Bryan, Mike and Eric.  During this conference call Vince, Vasant, Amitava and I pointed out some of the issues with the public firm models and the data used to develop these models.     In addition, after that conference call you, Bryan, Mike, Eric and I had further discussions as to how to sort out the public firm models.  During this discussion we all agreed that most of these issues had already been raised and addressed by George Albanis in the following documents:   1.  EnronCredit.com Project Proposal - Movement Model and Parallel Work - Phases IV,  by George Albanis, December 2000   2.  Meeting 25/01/2001 - Review, by George Albanis.     I also forwarded copies of these documents to you and Ben via email on May 11th.  Just in case you cant find them, I will forward them again.   Based on recent discussions with Jeff Kinneman, it is my understanding that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to figure out how to repair the public firm models.  Hence it may be more appropriate to direct any future concerns about the public firm models to their attention.

If you havent sent the report to him yet, perhaps we can request his opinions on best practices for testing models with limited quality out of sample test sets.  Obviously, Id like to discuss this in detail with you as well, especially since you understand the characteristics of the models and data better now, but Ill do that via phone.  Im hoping there are some statistical techniques were currently ignoring that we can employ to maximize the testing we do and get a better handle on judging our accuracy.  If youve got some time Tuesday after our meeting where Mike catches us up on the D&B issues, Id love to get your views as the model testbed is now in place and were starting a model recalbration phase.  Im least comfortable about our plans for stress testing the models once weve recalibrated them.  Looking forward to talking to you Tuesday.

Today we have two new whitepapers for you to browse through. Starting off we have a whitepaper from F-5 Networks.  In this whitepaper F-5 illustrates the features of their Internet Control Architecture system. F5 outlines the challenges of maintaining a content management system, including distribution, delivery and control of content and applications.  Secondly we have a whitepaper from Cisco which deals with using Intrusion Detecting Systems (IDS) solutions.  As always we have indexed all the current whitpapers on Network World Fusion at the end of this newsletter.   F-5 Networks An Advanced Internet Control Architecture For Creating Application Aware Networks  Many system administrators have struggled with the need to integrate content delivery solutions and custom applications to all points of their networks, while still managing costs.  This F5 Networks whitepaper offers the companys solutions to these problems.  The complexity of content management has stretched the limits of many networks and has often resulted in loses, temporary solutions and high costs.  With their content management system F5 says it is able to avoid many of these problems and allow centralized management of all points on a network.  Click the link below to read more about F5s Internet Control Architecture. http://nww1.com/go/f5_wp1119.html   Cisco Raising The Bar: Extending Cisco Intrusion Detection with A Host-Based Solution  This paper examines the combination of the existing NIDS and the new NIDS components in the Cisco IDS solution by exploring relevant security issues. It continues with an analysis of the extent of coverage provided by the combined solution and examines how well the different components complement each other. http://nww1.com/go/cisco_wp1119.html   Winternals Software Enterprise Defragmenters For Windows NT/2000: Cost and Benefits Compared  In this whitepaper Winternals Software explains the impact of defrag software.  Disk defragmentation is an area many companies are exploring in an effort to cut costs.  According to Winternals Software many defrag companies claim the use of defrag software may have a cost savings of nearly $350 annually per user.  Supported by figures and charts, Winternals Software demonstrates how ambitious this number appears to be.  In addition to the cost savings analysis, Winternals unveils other possible hurdles involved with defrag software.  To provide you with an alternative, Winternals Software introduces Defrag Commander.
