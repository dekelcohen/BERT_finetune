__label__DontSave	Meeting Request from Toshiba Sandeep,  I received a e-mail from Toshiba requesting a meeting to discuss collaboration between Enron.  Mr. Tatsumi states in the email that Vince told Toshiba that Enron would like to examine the Boltzmann model through the Tokyo office.  How would you like us to proceed with Toshiba?

__label__DontSave	Process for Tomorrow Vince,  As you meet with employees one-on-one tomorrow, you will want to cover a few items with them.  These are some things we determined through reductions in other groups that work fairly well:  have Shirley or your team admin prepared to receive all returned equipment (laptops, cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, American Express cards, long distance calling cards, etc.) have someone call Cingular to confirm that Enron accounts can be converted to personal accounts.  I believe there is a form that the employee would need to submit to Cingular prior to the termination date. Shirley should coordinate with each employee to verify that all pre-petition expenses have been paid and that all post-petition expenses have been submitted for reimbursement. Because you have some lead time, you might consider instructing employees on how they should leave their desk.  It is very helpful if employees can destroy old documents, return supplies to a central location and leave the desk clean. In the past we have realized after an employee leaves that we may not have the right contact information when needing to get in touch with them.  Attached is a template to have your employees update their personal information to ensure that any corespondance is appropriately sent.    Khymberly and I will both be in your meeting tomorrow at 3pm.

This is a second  tanker on which very few details are available . The LNG group is working as we speak to provide some information for Joe Sutton before his departure for Paris this (Tuesday) afternoon. There is no DASH on this 2nd tanker yet. I asked Dave Gorte on Monday to send me one and was not told that he can provide me with the Mystic Lady DASH as  the closest substitute.

What I am not sure of is what if any decision  has to be made on May 19.  It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals  have already been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or  two.  John    Vince J Kaminski 15/05/2000 17:14 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rick  Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision    John,  This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.  1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH  and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the  decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island  project (please, see point 2).  2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest  (Sally Becks organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island  transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enrons LNG-related  positions   in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is  meeting to close a few remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.  A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:  a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island  facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.  The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are  setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and  coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.  b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension  option of 5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for  such a long tenor. This is   essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread  and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.  One solution would be to  cover, lets say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the  first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.  c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a  big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market.  d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island  deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions. Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail  that  correlates very well with Brent.   Vince    John Sherriff 05/14/2000 01:40 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: LNG May 19 decision   Vince  I havent spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.   Anyway with Greg moving to his new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the  Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.  I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for  LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far  away).  Anway I understand this is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you  please let me know where you stand now?

The treasury rate at 12/28/00 was 5.127% (research uses 4.6% which probably  takes into account the recent Fed 50 bp cut) The maturity is 6/30/03 or 2.5 years (research uses 3 years)  Using these assumptions and a 47.2% volatility in the Bloomberg collar  function results in a ceiling of 92 103/256 and a floor of 34 7/8.  After  adjusting the research model for the changes above, Ryan and I got a similar  range from the research model so we are comfortable with these numbers.  Let me know if there are any questions.

__label__Save	Re: EOTT Options Tracy,  Attached is a spreadsheet model which contains both Black-Scholes and  American option valuation models.   These are the generally accepted methods  for valuation of options on equity.   The European option prices assume  that the option holder can exercise his options only at maturity, while the  American style options can be exercised at any time during their life.     I have assumed in the examples that the underlying equity units have a market  value of $13.00 and that the options are struck at this level.   The  volatility input is the other main assumption.   EOTT has been trading  recently with a volatility ranging between 30% to 40% although looking  further back, the range is much wider.  To run the model, you must be linked with the options library.   I am not  sure what lan you are connected with, but you can coordinate with Zimin Lu  (x36388) for help with loading the option library add-in module.   On the ENA  lan it is located under  O:\research\exotica\xll\exotica.xll.    This is  loaded in excel using the Tools/Add-Ins and Browse to reach the add-in  location.  --Stinson x34748    P.S.

If you are in the Stanford area during the holidays, lets get together some time to have dinner.  I have formally established the project - thanks again for funding it - and I have also recruited the second PhD student. His name is Eric Cope, and he is a top-notch student, very mature, and entrepreneurial!  We have started working on some interesting problems in this area. I would hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into the problem/opportunity generation environment. That really helps the  student to develop a realistic vision about their research.  Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quarter, say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing. And of  course you could visit us before that too.

__label__DontSave	RE: Factor Loadings Process Ramesh,   I believe the inception document for automating VaR processes you prepared in April already covers the requirements David has listed with minimal changes. Please review and comment as needed.        -----Original Message----- From:  Port, David   Sent: Tuesday, June 05, 2001 9:29 AM To: Stock, Stephen; Brackett, Debbie R.; Apollo, Beth Cc: Kaminski, Vince J; Buy, Rick; Andrews, Naveen; Adams, Matthew Subject: Factor Loadings Process  As an FYI for those not already in the loop, new factors for VaR have not been implemented since some time in April, and it seems the process of administering them is foggy.  So here is an outline of the R&R and required technology to support the administration of factor loadings:     << File: FactorLoadingProcess.doc >>   Broadly, I have assumed that Global Risk Ops can run the process. However, exceptions can take one of two forms:  Large jumps in VaR due to bona fide changes in correlations; Pathologies in the matrix construct supporting factors;  For either, tools are required for users to examine the exceptions and make changes as necessary (generally Global ops in the former case and RAC/Research in the latter).  Note that the IT Development group has no part in this business process beyond building the tools.  Lets use this as the starting point to develop a business model that makes this work.

__label__Save	Re: convergence of the Research model I was curious about the accuracy of our credit reserve model as a function of  the number of simulations we use. This question, I think, is not so important  when we  calculate credit reserve, because the assumptions underlying our model are  pretty  rough anyway (here I mean the assumptions regarding price processes,  correlations, etc.)  This question becomes more essential when we talk about calculating  sensitivities of the  credit reserve to various factors. When the magnitude of the sensitivity is  comparable to the accuracy of calculation of the credit reserve, what is the accuracy of  such sensitivity?    I performed a numerical experiment where I calculated the expected loss for a simple portfolio with one counterparty (SITHE IND POWER) for different number of simulations (10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000) using old research  credit model. You can see how the result converges and the relative error (compared to the  result for 100000 simulations which is assumed to be the most accurate) in  the  attached file.  Tanya.

__label__Save	Pricing credit on thousands of names All -  Our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [5,000 by year-end].  Most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information,  making the challenge harder, and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage. What we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective.  Currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development: FMC Model (default probability approach). Using Bloombergs Fair Market (par  yield) Curves, probabilities are generated from the risky-LIBOR, then  default/bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology. FMC Model (credit spread approach). Using the FMCs, then directly taking the  LIBOR credit spread at each tenor, adjusting for basis and compounding  differences. Bond Model (FMC approach). Taking the FMCs as benchmark curves, the model  regresses the input bonds (specific to a name) on the two best fitting  benchmarks. The result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the FMCs,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer. Prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches. Under testing. Bond Model (spline approach). Taking only the bonds specific to an issuer,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero-coupon price curve,  then builds a zero yield curve from this. Under testing. Market Prices. For certain liquid names, or sectors/ratings, CDS market  prices are used, then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices. KMV. Using Expected Default Frequencies (EDFs) from the KMV model and  database, we will build a model to price default swaps, making appropriate  risk adjustments. KMV is being installed now, so model will be worked on next.  Each of these models returns a price (credit default and bankruptcy), and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and CDS markets, recovery assumptions, risk premia,  capital charges, etc. The aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible, based upon these models, then use these prices, alongside  other financial information, as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system.   Our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers, alongside name-specific soft data from  credit reports and financial statements. If the credit is liquid enough, a  price will be generated from their own information only. Otherwise, the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits, with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights.  The model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market (or trader) prices, and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition. In loose terms, we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices (bonds, equities, default swaps), where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis, financial ratios, etc.  The key steps to implementing such a system will be: Establishing what exactly we want to predict - is it a price, a rating, a  probability, or a score? We will need a clean market history to calibrate to,  which we only really have for ratings. We will then need to develop a mapping  from rating/score to price. Getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model. Building the mechanics of the model, ie, the calibration methodology. Neural  nets/fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates, but which exact methods and  software packages to use? Determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model. Getting the true market price, in order to feed back an error. At present  such a price exists for very few credits. Allocating resources to the development. McKinsey claimed such a system would  take 6-10 man-months to develop.  Further ideas or comments are requested, as we need to develop our strategy  asap. The model description above is fairly vague, as we dont yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details. Further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at internet speed.

__label__DontSave	Mtg with John Sherriff et al Hi Vince  I tried dialling you around 3pm UK time, and again at 3:30, but with no  luck.  I met with John, Michael Brown, Tani, Joe Gold and Richard Lewis.  The meeting was productive, and all were positive about expanding the  Research team provided: 1. The people are working directly on commercial problems. 2. An outflow is eventually set up to match the inflow, so that Research acts  as a training ground for commercial-quality quantitative PhDs.  Since they acknowledge that some lag will be necessary before we can bear any  kind of outflow, this gives us an effective increase in headcount.  Michael  Brown has agreed to a target (ambitious, but worth trying) of hiring two  commercial quality PhDs per quarter, on the agreement that in time we have an  outflow equal to this.  Given the current attempts to curtail hiring of support staff, I feel this  is as good a result as could be expected, and Im certainly happy with it.

Im going to leave for Houston on May 29 (expected time to arrival is around noon) I am very much excited to have opportunity to join the project making an exchange platform.  I think its time Id better remind you of scheduling a meeting with me, sometime on May 30.  I hope you let me know what to to after I arrive at Houston. And please let me know if you have anything you think I prepare, to get better outcome from the summer work. If you give me a brief on the work, it would be a great help for me to decide which material I should carry from here to Houston.  I look forward to the date we meet, Warm regards,  Jinbaek  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Jinbaek Kim Ph.D Candidate Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research U.C.Berkeley http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~jinbaek  Go Bears!        :._..---.._.;       `.             .       .           `.      :      a   a      :                 __....._      :     _.-0-._     :----....--        .       :  .   :   `.  :                          `,`.        `.: ---- :.                             ; ;         : `._`-_.                                ;.         `.                                      ;          `.                                       ;           `.     `        :           `            ;            .`.    ;       ;           :           ;          .    `-.      ;            :          ;`.      __.      .      .              :        ;   `.    .      __.      .`--..__      _._.      ;      ;    `......        .         ``.        ;......-          `.......-                 `........

We were introduced to this group inside Toshiba through the Carlyle Groups Japan office.  Dr. Uenohara, from Toshiba, is travelling to New York City to speak at the 11th INFORMS Applied Probability Society Conference.  The URL is: http://www.cap.columbia.edu/informs-aps/ap-2001.html  Dr. Uenohara is interested in applying this model to power markets and would very much like to speak with someone from Enron during his trip to the US.  Is anyone from Enron going to be attending the conference?  If there is someone going, it would be worthwhile to facilitate a meeting.  If not, Dr. Uehara has stated he would travel to Houston between the dates of July 31 and August 4 to explain his model and the possibility of working with Enron.  Toshiba is currently working with Daiwa here in Japan, however they told us in the meeting that Daiwa was way too slow and they were looking for other companies to work with in the application of the model to different types of markets.  Please give me the name of a suitable contact in the event that we are able to arrange a visit for Dr. Uenohara to Houston.  Toshiba will be sending me the presentations we received today and I will forward them to you as soon as I receive them.   Regards, Mark Brady  Mark Brady Enron Japan Corp.

I certainly  appreciate the value-added that you provide in your research.I had a quick  question for you regarding any anticipated Japan central bank intervention at  the 15,000 level in the Nikkei. If I am understanding the mechanism correctly, BIS reserve requirements fall  below certain threshold and banks can no longer lend money and meet BIS  lending criteria due to improper reserve base. And this roughly happens at  15,000 level?  Reason I ask is Goldman Sachs put out an article suggesting that  break-evenpoint for bank holding of stocks is roughly 12,000-12,500 a  different index level than the one you have mentioned.    I can appreciate the difference between reserve liquidity and actual  break-even on equity positions, but just wanted to clarify this point with  you, as we are trying to gain a complete understanding of how a trigger would  effect Japanese capital markets. And so, as I currently understand it, there  are (2 ) trigger levels to watch:  15,000 where banks fail BIS criteria and hence cannot extend new loans with  BIS stamp of approval. Clearly ctl bank would have incentive in restoring  this or else financial system would be thrown into turmoil.  12500 where banks begin to take an actual loss on equity holdings  Is this right?

The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enrons research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enrons research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs.   We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enrons eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the users desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.    As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like Industry Overviews and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.   IN THE NEWS  Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday.  In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year.  We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

__label__DontSave	Re: EnergyDesk Hi Vince  James New from London Risk Mgt has asked me to sign off the computations in  EnergyDesk.com for use in Oslo offices new system.  Im a little  uncomfortable with this since: 1. Sign off of models is something that Ive been brought up to consider to  be the domain of RAC.  They disagree in part (see below), which leads me to... 2. London Research is not the owner of Exotica, and we dont necessarily  have the time/resource/expertise to audit Houston Researchs code.  Indeed,  can Research group sign off their own efforts?  By definition the originating  group for a piece of code thinks its OK, or they wouldnt have written it  that way. 3. Im concerned about Research group code being sold to external clients  without Research involvement.  (I received a query a couple of weeks ago from  an EnergyDesk.com guy, Jan Lillehammer, who said he was planning to sell our  VaR system, and asked if he could have a copy!)  Ive tried to emphasise that we support Exotica for internal purposes only,  and that our entire setup presupposes the presence of resident quants on the  trading floor to support the tools that Research write.  Your advice/guidance would be appreciated.

The standard models used at Enron, like SPRDOPT and other routines  in Exotica.xls are written by Research and therefore I have always assumed  endorsed by Research. Having said that I do believe firmly that all RAC - MRM  folks should have a deep understanding of the way products are valued and be  able to assess and challenge a method.   I am also happy to provide assistance in the process of designing a method  but I wouldnt want either of us to feel that RAC are in the way of progress  by being embedded in a project plan.   In this instance, given the appropriate documentation, I would imagine the  time taken to assess the EnergyDesk methodology would be very short - what do  you have that I could look at ?

I thought that it was a requirement that all valuation engines (and any  future changes to the valuation code) are required to be signed off by  research and RAC before they can be used to value the firms positions. If  this is true then this is all I am looking to get onto the project plan the  time estimates you need to complete your review process. If there is no  requirement for RAC or research to sign off new or changed valuation engines  then I will trouble you no further.

We were hoping to be able to include a stop at Enron on our itinerary. Right now it appears that Friday, May 4th would work best for us but were at the very beginning of our trip planning.  The purpose of our visit would be to review the current relationship between Enron and Stanford, to give you an overview of current priorities in the School of Engineering, and ask for your help in identifying the best points of contact.  I look forward to hearing from you about your availability,  Sincerely, Susan Hansen     Susan C.

ANALYSIS http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eIfr0BHCKe0CjE0B4V0A2 Why insurers are making slow progress towards e-commerce. Complaints amid the compliments: banks, associations and regulators respond to Basle II.  VIEWPOINT http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eIfr0BHCKe0CjE0B4X0A4 As chief risk officer, Walter Smiechewicz was charged with developing an enterprise risk management framework at Old Kent, a relatively unusual undertaking for such a small firm. The bank&#8217;s recent merger with fellow regional Fifth Third put an end to the programme, but as Smiechewicz tells ERisks Duncan Wood in our latest Q&A, it learnt a lot of valuable lessons along the way.  JOB LISTINGS http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eIfr0BHCKe0CjE0Bie0AB Among the opportunities posted in our Job Listings section this month: positions in corporate treasury, investment risk management and bank credit risk management.

__label__DontSave	Re: VaR questions Vlady, here are my comments:  1. NG Correlations :  - leave existing methodology while using more recent data (1 month instead of  3 months). This should go anong with running the calibration code more  frequently  (at least once a week); - put the version with weighting for correlation into production.  2. Implement term structure of correlations for selected groups of  commodities through joint factor loadings estimation for each of these groups  I experimented with a group of Brent and 61NY, Christian is working with WTI,  Brent, C3GC. The experiments should identify suitable groups.  IT needs to provide a column in some rms table to identify the groups and  slightly modify vatrfacs code. This will address power correlations as well. 3. FFvols: Smoothing methodology for implied vol curves corresponding to each  of 12 months  - develop solutions for improving the existing methodology (Research)  - implement the proposed solutions (Research, IT)  - test the results (Research, RAC) 4. Jump Diffusion - NG: finding the evidence of jumps, not obvious. 5 & 6. - I agree. 7 IR & FX Var in RiskTrack - should be probably #1 in this list.   - the VAR code is ready,   - some results for IR VAR are validated already. (IT, Research, Risk  Control)   - some minor modifications to calibration code vatrfacs are required  (related to FX data) (IT);  - data completeness and consistency is still a problem, specifically:  Futures rates (Infinity, IT);  - FX books are not set up properly (Risk Control, IT)  Tanya.

As you are aware much of the work  requires exploring uncharted territory and the team has confirmed the  significant contribution that Amitavas experience and expertise has provided  in a very short timeframe.  As you might expect, this quickly confirms that we really need more dedicated  support from someone with Amitavas background.  It is imperative that we  leverage his experience to speed up the process and apply critical insights  into our project.  This will not only speed up the work considerably but also  ensure that we have put our best team on the difficult issues in front of us.  I would like to discuss an arrangement where we can ensure Amitava is more  integrated into our efforts.  I realize it will be difficult to free him up  but maybe we can put something together which works for everybody.  some early ideas:    have amitava and family come over for 6 weeks of dedicated support.  this  should allow us to develop the communication processes to run a global quant  effort for the project and then continue with Amitava a full time EC.com  resource working from Houston.  This is likely my preference.  or  agree a schedule of regular trips which allows Amitava to provide critical  insights and oversight of the project and give our team a resource to extract  his experience on an ongoing basis.

The purpose of the FMRC is to stimulate research on financial markets and to provide a link between academic research, real world issues and regulation. Members of the center sit on the advisory board and help direct the research of the center. They send an unlimited number of participants to center conferences. Our center is unique in its mix of academics, practitioners and regulators. For members, such as Enron, it provides a window on the academic world, and would give Enron an opportunity to stimulate research in the use of markets in heretofore unusual commodities.  More information on the center can be found at http://mba.vanderbilt.edu/fmrc/  Center members include, NYSE, Nasdaq, CME, some high tech trading firms, Merrill Lynch....  Joining the center usually requires a top management decision, but I would approach it through the research and the trading areas. One way to start is to see if anyone in a position to recommend joining the center would like to attend this years conference on April 13 -14. The program is on the web site.

I really enjoyed our discussions, both at the technical level and otherwise.  I promised to send you an e-mail regarding possible dates for a visit to Enron. I delayed it for a week till my schedule was clearer. Lets see if we can get a match with your schedule - mine is rather terrible:  Friday, 21st of April looks good. But April 23rd is Easter Sunday, so that may make it difficult for some people at Enron to be around. Let me know if that is the case. I am willing to visit then, because the week after that I am scheduled to be in Japan and in the previous weeks I am all committed on Fridays.  Friday, 19th of May is the next possibility, but this probably is too far out. The main problem is that I am operating within a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this research. This window closes by the end of April, and it would be important for the student support funds to be in place then, so that I can make hard commitments to students and attract top talent. I am already reviewing files of students who have approached me for PhD advising, and I am in a mode of doing soft commitments to star-level students to get this research and its potential on their radar screen. Top students are highly sought after by advisors and I want to be an early player in this competition.  Does my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up the project and student support at Stanford? If so, doing it before the end of April is important for getting top people. If the visit can happen after we get the ball rolling, then we can schedule it in May. I assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets going.

He expressed that the Wessex people had originated the data and  that the graph was correct, to the best of their knowledge.  The only (but  very important correction) is that they started the graph at an index of  100%, which does not imply a 100% of RAB multiple.  Rather, the initial RAB  multiple was around 80%, implying that the entire line should be taken down  by 20 percentile points.  Thus the all time hime in late 98 should be closer  to the 1.3x RAB that I had targeted during our discussion.  Please call Keith  if he has not yet contact you.

I referred to low correlations between NG and west power curves which I observed for recent data (NGI-SOCAL and R8, for example).  To capture properly term structure of correlations we need to increase the number of factors and do joint factors analysis for all curves.

__label__Save	Re: Outage Tracker Option And Background Karl,  Thanks a lot. I have passed this information to Grant Masson who worked here on a related problem. He will get in touch with you regarding this technology.  Vince      Karl Tomlinson@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 07/24/2000 06:00 PM To: Vince J Kaminski@ECT cc:   Subject: Outage Tracker Option And Background   Vince,  To follow up on the idea of a means for effectively tracking instantanious  plant faliure utilising either system frequency or connection point voltage.  The system frequency phase shift across a network will probably be the best  option as this would allow alll significant deviations to be tracked along  with relative network performance from a few points.  I am currently chasing NEMMCO (AU system operator) to get hold of a few weeks  of 4 second metering data for the whole system to see if there is enough  measurement consistency to prove one of the ideas.  The idea follows along the lines (literally !) that when a unit fails it will  introduce a shock into the system and reduce system frequency, which is then  reacted to by frequency control services offered in by generators. The drop  in frequency is noticable across the whole network and as one option may  change the phase shift across the whole grid. The phase shift across the  network is constantly changing due to loads and power factor correctrion  devices switching on and off, however a unit failure may be distinct.  The second option relates to how a unit fails, whereby if a circuit breaker  is involved as in the case of uncontrolled shutdowns, then the outage will  cause an RF pulse that should propogate across some of the network.  Transformers will attenuate the pulse, however it should be detectable many  miles away from the fault location. Measure the arrival time at several point  on the network, work out the shift and backtrack on the network. Part of the  solution is already proven in lightning trackers. The solution may be made  more simple by detecting the exact point on the sinewave that the unit failed  (i.e. measuring the three phases at 1MHz and then sending the data through a  DSP). This solution is more complex, however this should allow unit failure  to be pinpointed to a station. The timing base for each of the nodes may be  sourced from GPS timing, self locating at the same time !  Will send you some links and documents for potentail hardware and setups.   Karl.

Deal with seismic company was done by a Mark Peterson who is still with  Enron.  I havent caught up with him for details but it had to do with  underwriting (risk of no sales) seismic survey.  Timing is important.   Interest may have picked up in new surveys and the survey company decided  that they didnt need Enron anymore because they no longer saw a risk of no  sales.    2. 3-D surveys will happen where there is an abundance of E & P activity or  be spurred on by successes in a given basin.  While activity continues in the  Gulf of Mexico on the shelf, the major discoveries are being found in the  deep water.  Worldwide, the shallow water plays have been looked at and  worked for years - they were accessible with the extraction technology of the  time.  I dont think that deep water sedimentation /depositional systems were  completely understood to even begin to try to justify looking in deep water.   Concepts have evolved quite quickly.  The point is that many deep water  accumulations are incredibly large - billion barrel accumulations.  These  sizes are like those accumulations that were found decades ago when companies  were drilling surface structures.  The large reserves are needed to pay for  the corresponding incredibly expensive costs of deepwater field development.   I believe that finding and development costs ($/barrel) are at least two to  three times shelf f & d costs in the Gulf of Mexico.  This differential is  probably large with international projects (and that doesnt take into  account political risk).   Ill look forward to more involvement if and when this project /concept goes  forward.  Feel free to forward this to all participants.

__label__Save	Inflation Model Review - Final Version This morning a draft of RACs Inflation Model Review was discussed with Anjam.  All points as presented in the draft were agreed upon.  Also, four new points were amended as suggested by Anjam:  The RPI short-term model could be improved by a combination of the  information available from the GILTS and RPI Swaps market. Add:  This is an issue across all Enrons econometric models. to section  PLLU and DZCV Short-term, First Point. To implement some of the suggestions requires additional statistical and  programming resources. Additionnal human resources with advanced econometric modelling skills are  required given the current workload of the european research team.  Please find the final version attached.  Please note that the short term solution has been to freeze the curve.  The medium to long term solution involves futher research towards a sounder  and more efficient model. Given the current workload of the European Research Group, it is necessary to  hire a new member of staff with strong economics and econometrics background  to address this issue properly.  RAC will communicate to the Financial Trading Group and Risk Management the  actions to take as the curve will be frozen.

__label__DontSave	GARP 2001 Convention Dear GARP 2001 Speaker ? This is just a quick note to keep you up-to-date  with developments at the  GARP 2001 Convention, which will be  held in New York between 12th and 15th  February, 2001. ? Thus far, GARP 2001 looks set to far exceed our  expectations and GARP 2000.  There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001  Convention. Delegate  bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As  a result, we are  set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention  earlier this year.  The three workshops and the one-day Asset Management Forum  are also very  well received and will probably reach full capacity. I will of  course  provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of the  event. ? Regarding the event itself, I would like a few  outstanding issues: ? 1. Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15th  December, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in a  delegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas and New  York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sure you can  appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need to be taken  into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are required as soon as  possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request you bring your  presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppy disc or a  laptop. ? 2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of what audio-visual  requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection - notably  PowerPoint).  ? 3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If you  have not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to my  colleague, Claire as soon as possible. ? If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact me,  otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course. ? I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February. ?

__label__DontSave	Enron Metals Update In my summer update about the acquisition of MG Plc and the integration of=  the metals business into Enron, I reported that we were aiming to complete=  the integration by the end of the year. I am pleased to report that we are=  well on the way to meeting this target.   September was a busy month for the metals business as it brought with it bo= th the co-location of the London and Tokyo-based metals staff with Enron=01,s=  offices and the first quarter of combined reporting under Enron Europe.  Ensuring a smooth transition for both the metals staff and the metals syste= ms into our London headquarters took a tremendous amount of co-ordination by=  teams across the company on the part of the former MG team and the integration team at Enron Europe.  Nevertheless, =01&D-Day=018 arrived with=  minimal problems and the metals team open for business as usual on the morning of=  September 18th.   Another key initiative that commenced during September was the re-positioni= ng of the MG worldwide metals business as Enron Metals. With the exception of=  the Henry Bath & Son Limited warehousing division, which will remain as currently named, the re-branding initiative was kicked off in the UK and followed by Japan and the US.  The re-branding initiative is on going with=  all other remaining regions set to undergo completion of the name change by=  the end of November.  Enron Metals is represented throughout the world.  I have attached a region= al office summary that depicts Enron Metals=01, locations (Appendix I).  In light of the progress that has been made since the summer, I thought it=  would be helpful to provide you with a brief recap of Enron Metals=01, core=  business areas and identify those members of the metals team who will be leading commercial efforts moving forward.  Merchanting Division  The Merchanting Division, led by Michael Farmer (+44 (0)20 7783 2049), is a=  worldwide copper merchant, one of the top three independent merchants of copper concentrates and nickel and the leading European merchant of recycle= d non-ferrous metals.  Core activities of the merchanting division are:  ? Merchanting of Non-ferrous Metals =01) Enron Metals trades as a principal=  with producers and consumers, buying and selling non-ferrous metals and concentrates (particularly copper, aluminum and nickel), exchanging qualiti= es and locations and lending and borrowing metals. ? Global Stockholding =01) Through its affiliate, Henry Bath & Son Limited,=  Enron Metals holds stocks of non-ferrous metals at warehouses around the world. ? Merchanting of Recycled Metal =01) Enron Metals trades as a principal wit= h suppliers and consumers of non-ferrous metal for recycling.  Enron has augmented its European recycling platform through the acquisition of assets=  of W&O Bergmann, the leading German Recycling Business.   Financial Services Division  The Financial Services Division, led by Michael Hutchinson (+44 (0)20 7783=  2079), provides market-making and trading services to Enron Metal=01,s phys= ical metals trading business through futures trading as a member of the London=  Metal Exchange and as a member of COMEX in New York.  The Financial Service= s Division will continue to be comprised of brokerage activities for LME and=  COMEX contracts and be a market-maker for both futures and options contract= s on the LME and COMEX and in OTC metals contracts.  With much of the metals business moving to online trading, significant effo= rt has been put into getting metals contracts incorporated into EnronOnline=01= ,s portfolio of product offerings since the metals business=01, integration in= to Enron this summer.  Today on EnronOnline we are trading six metals (Copper,=  Aluminium, Nickel, Zinc, Lead and Tin) with over 150 products available.  Enron Metals now has almost 800 financial counterparties on the books, with=  300 of these having EnronOnline accounts.  Trading volumes have increased=  from a couple of trades per day in September to a high of 300 in October. T= he attached charts depict the established metals results compared to the start=  up of US natgas (Appendix II).  Origination  Enron Metals established a London-based commercial unit under the direction=  of Eric Gadd, Vice President-Global Metals Origination which is focused on=  completing highly structured and long-dated transactions.  It will integrat= e with existing merchanting and financial service competencies to lever up earnings creation.  Currently, the origination team is working on a number = of Q4 transactions in Australia and the Americas.  The deal pipeline for Q2 ha= s prospects in not only these regions but also Europe/Africa and the Middle/F= ar East.   Close and regular communication between the metal origination team=  and other business units inside Enron is essential if we are to succeed in=  building a new capability to achieve earnings targets and deliver sharehold= er value through Enron Metals.  Your active involvement and close co-operation=  here is appreciated.  Warehousing (Henry Bath & Son Limited)   The Warehousing operations, led by Ed Dablin, operate under the name of Hen= ry Bath & Son Limited.  Henry Bath has been in business for more than 200 year= s and maintains a global operation for the physical handling and storage of=  non-ferrous metals, including zinc, tin, copper, nickel, lead and aluminum.=   Henry Bath provides support to both the Merchanting and Financial Services=  Divisions, and also engages in independent warehousing operations.  Its cor= e activities include worldwide storage of metals and other products such as=  cocoa, general goods and worldwide shipping services.  Presently, Henry Bath maintains over three million square feet of storage=  worldwide (most of which is leased), with the largest facilities located in=  the United Kingdom (Liverpool, London, Bristol, Immingham), the Netherlands=  (Rotterdam), Spain (Bilbao, Barcelona), Singapore, and the United States (N= ew Haven, New Orleans and Los Angeles).  Rob Soeldner is managing the integration efforts for me.   Please feel free=  to contact him at +44 (0)20 7783 7169 with any questions regarding the business.

__label__Save	Re: Power Plant Model Hi Vince:  Number one below is fine...the more accurate the EBITDA model the better.   Your tweaking of the model at this point wont create any Chinese Wall  problems.  Michelle and Gary will talk about the programmer issue on Monday, and get  back to you.  I apologize if there was any confusion.  Were certainly  grateful for Alexs involvement.  Today is my last day of Associate rotation within the Financial Trading  group, and I start at EES on Monday.  I handed off the project as best I  could, and of course will be available if you need me.  My e-mail and phone  number will be the same.  Have a nice weekend.

We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like  to discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of  our insights to the consultant. In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the  details and in the inputs and calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results  depending on the quality of inputs.   2. We dont have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We  were told that you would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person.   Vince Jeff M Gray jeff.gray@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com

__label__Save	WTI maket maker simulation model John,  We finished the Version 2 of the simulation model which deals with the open-close trading versus the continuous trading in the previous version.  I added the cummulative P/L as an output.   There are a few apparent trading strategies from this model:  1) Higher bid/offer spread, more profit 2) More Daily # of trades, more profit 3) Smaller net open positions allowed, more profit  1) and 2) are obvious, but 3) is more interesting.  It means that we are  better off if we do not allowed net open positions at end of the day.  In a trending  market, this makes an intuitive sense, for example, in the case of bull market we are  short as a market maker and we can avoid the loss at the higher openning price by keeping zero or small net short positions.  I have attached the model with this mail, and Ill  be happy to discuss the  model in more details with you.

__label__Save	Re: The consultants model for Gary Hickersons group The model is supposed to be a real option model to capture the value of power plants of Gencos. It is to give trader a better insight as to whether  the market is overvaluing/undervaluing certain Genco stocks, and trader can act accordingly.  Im still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use  it.   Modeling details: The model takes in all Gencos locational power forward prices and fuel  forward prices, and uses GARCH model to simulate one year daily prices, and then uses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices.  GARCH model  parameters are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and  are updated twice a year, and it does not matter whether the simulation starts in January or September.   Using these prices, it will determine whether a unit at a particular location  will be dispatched or not depending on A) spread of power and fuel prices, and B) whether the  start-up cost can be recovered during 8 operation hours.  The unit can be dispatched at minimum and peak levels. Fixed O&M, SOX and NOX (I dont know what the last  two stand for) are taken into consideration.   With the simulated dispatch schedule, the model calculates the value that can  be generated by this unit, then sums it up across all units.  The final value is the average of 100 simulations.  And it takes about 16  hours to run for about 200 units.    After our conversation, the consultant promised to look into A) how to make  the model more flexible, say, to allow a different time horizon, B) reduce spreadsheet overhead by  doing calculation one unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information (as of now it  saves everything  on the spreadsheet).  Assuming the GARCH process is modelled correctly, I believe the methodology  is OK, though  it does not capture most of  the optionality.   My concerns are: Whether the price processes are modelled correctly. I have to get more  details before making any conclusion.  100 simulations are way too few. Unless we convert the algorithm to C, I  dont see how spreadsheet can handle more simulations. I guess thats why they contact us. But again,  if Enrons buying the model from the consulting company, why should Enron do their job for them?  How traders going to use the model output. For this I phoned Jeff (the  associate who initiated all these) and am still waiting for his returning call.  A related questions why  the model horizon is one year.   We can either Oversee the conversation, but not doing actual coding for them. Or Redo the model for them. (The problem still remains that how traders going  to use the output).  But  in view of the Great Wall of China separating the business units, should we  do it?  As of now I have a simulation model taking start-up cost, fixed O&M, rump-up  delay into consideration.   It simulates monthly prices (using GBM) and takes 2 minutes 40 seconds to run  10,000 simulations for  one unit for ten years (120 time steps).  It can use forward-forward vol and  incorporate seasonality into it (I understand this is debatable). (One interesting observation is that  when using forward-forward vol simulation, the standard deviation is about 0.5%, while standard deviation  using forward vol is about  2%. Also, incorporating seasonality increases the value by about 1.6%). Since  most of the time-cost  occurs in price simulation, and we are to simulate about 20 price processes,   I hope the full model  (if we build it) will take a couple of hours to run for 200 units. The main  task will be interfacing, i.e.,  getting data from data base, and outputting the results. This is where I need  most help if I am to do it.  Please advice the course of action. I am supposed to talk to Michelle  Cisneros today.  p.s. I never promised to oversee a programmer in our group (see the message  below).

__label__Save	Re: Full version I read the chapter. Generally, I like it, and find it non-controversial and well written. Of course, this is a huge topic and there are things that you havent discussed.  I thought the amount of attention paid to OLS and MLE estimation was a bit overboard, given that you didnt really exploit it in your results. If you were to state the likelihood function for the GARCH model, it might justify the amount of attention to gave to estimation for simple iid processes, which could then be thought of as a simple lead-in and intuition builder to the more interesting models that you do actually use.  By the way, in your discussion of smiles, you discuss fat tails extensively. At least for equity markets, while fat tails contribute, they dont do very much at all compared to the effect of risk premia, which you allude to briefly, using supply-demand language, at the end of that section.  For the impact of risk premia, see Jun Pans paper, which is available from her web page. But she covers only SP500, (as do most studies), and your markets are obviously much different.  The chapter will be a good service to your readers!

__label__Save	retail markets conference I would like to invite you to participate in a conference on Retail Participation in Competitive Power Markets to be held at Stanford University on June 21-22, 2001. Although California and other regional markets will likely be introducing some demand-response programs by June, there is a clear need for continual evaluation of these nascent efforts to transform the market. The conference provides an opportunity to learn from different experiences.  This policy research meeting will focus on establishing a foundation for understanding the key concepts and methods for demand response programs and to provide an opportunity for participants to raise questions and recommend directions for additional research and analysis.  Participants will come from companies, government, and universities.  You can obtain more information about the conference by checking under Meetings on our EMF website listed below.  Please let me know if you plan on attending.  Also, if you would like to make a brief 15-minute presentation, please let me know your topic and describe it in a few sentences.  I will try to choose speakers that will cover the full range of interests represented by this group.  Researchers should focus on the implications of their analysis for designing demand response programs rather than on the technical details of their methodology.  I would also encourage practitioners to discuss their experience in implementing demand response programs or in raising selected issues.

Vince      Tom Arnold <tmarnol@lsu.edu> on 04/25/2001 09:15:09 AM To: Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com cc:   Subject: Potential Prospect   Hey Vince,  Given that the Eastern Finance Conference is already taking place, I think it is safe to assume that they did not desire an energy derivative round table discussion.  However, I appreciate you volunteering to potentially having been on such a round table discussion.  Ive been teaching a real options course that has the students performing monte carlo analysis, Black-Scholes pricing, and binomial pricing along with a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing.  A few of your new hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course. However, I have a student who will be finishing his MBA next spring that is particularly good.  He is genuinely interested and curious about option pricing, trading, and hedging with Excel/VBA skills.  In fact, he usually figures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations.  This is not to say that some of my other students arent very talented themselves, but that this person really stands out.  Do you think you and/or Enron would be interested in such a person?  If so, what do you recommend that he do to get his foot in the door?  His intention is to finish the MBA, but I do not know if this would preclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now.  His name is George Moss and I ordinarily would not bother you directly about a potential employee.  I am making an exception in this case because he is a particularly good talent without being the slightest bit arrogant.  Otherwise, I hope this e-mail finds you doing well and not travelling too much.  Tom Professor Tom Arnold E.J.

A US data base - archives date back to 1988.  This database has various fields describing default and nondefault loans, etc. ? A public and private firm model (both) for an annual subscription rate of $75,000.  These models estimate PDs for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. ?

__label__Save	CORRECTED: New Update on PPI Model for Inflation Book Dear all,  I followed up on the suggestions at the conference call as follows:-  1) USE LESS DATA  Unfortunately, kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less  robust, in fact dramatically so, and so eliminates the possibility of using  less data.  The model tested was the RPI(month+15) & Deviations from  long-term average for Brent Crude.  The r-squared and F-statistic collapsed  by eliminating the first 12 months of data.  2) DEVIATIONS IN CRUDE VARIABLE  Shifting the crude explanatory variable backwards and forward by 3 and 6  months did not alter the model goodness-of-fit parameters dramatically and so  my suggestion is that we stick with the following model:  PLLU[t] = a.RPI[t] + b.RPI[t+15] + c.BrentCrudeDeviations[t] + Constant  3) TESTING MODEL WITH SINE WAVE  To gauge the response of the model to wildly-varying RPI forward curve, a  sine wave of period 3 years for RPI was input into the PPI model.  The result  was as expected; PPI pre-empts the moves in RPI by about 8 months.  The  magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced.  This shows that if we had  more detail in our RPI forward curve, then the PPI model would reflect those  peaks and humps adequately.    CONCLUSION  I therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates RPI, RPI[t+15]  and deviations of Brent Crude from long-term average.  The new model is  plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old PPI which is  depicted in blue.   The new model achieves the two main objectives of the PPI curve: it is  significantly more robust and stable than the existing one, and it is  considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients, which results in us  having more confidence in our monthly P&L.   Please note that all this analysis only applies to PLLU, and that a separate  study will be needed for the DZCV PPI index.  Regards,  Anjam x35383  ---------------------- Forwarded by Anjam Ahmad/LON/ECT on 09/03/2000 16:52  ---------------------------   Anjam Ahmad 08/03/2000 14:03 To: Martina Angelova/LON/ECT@ECT, Harry Arora/HOU/ECT@ECT, Maureen  Raymond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT, Farouk Lalji/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Trena McFarland/LON/ECT@ECT, Dale Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT, Stinson  Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Leandro  Ibasco/Corp/Enron@Enron   Subject: Update on PPI Model for Inflation Book  Dear all,  We thought it might be useful to incorporate Brent crude as an explanatory  variable for PPI; it was found that deviations of Dated Brent Crude from the  long-term average of $18.80 was the best form of the variable to use (for  predictions the Brent forward curve produced by the Global Products Group is  used).  The three new equations developed were:-  PLLU(t) = a.RPI(t) + b.RPI(t+N) + c.(DatedBrentCrude - 18.8) + constant,  where N is 14,15 or 16 [REDDISH CURVES] r-squared approx 0.49 F-stat approx 32  The chart below shows what our projected PLLU curve would be given this  equation, and also the three best relations from before which were based upon  current and future RPI:  PLLU(t) = a.RPI(t) + b.RPI(t+N) + constant, where N is 14,15 or 16 [GREENISH CURVES] r-squared approx 0.47 F-stat approx 45  COMPARISON OF MODELS As you can see, the two equations differ in the very short-term and very  long-term; the inclusion of deviations of Brent Crude leads to short-term  predictions of 3.0% to 3.2% over the next six months.  The greenish curves  predict PLLU in the range of 2.5% to 2.8% over the next six months.  The curves are then very similar until 2009, when the models including crude  break-away to the upside, relative to the falling RPI curve.  The model based  purely on RPI hugs the RPI curve much more closely in the longer term.  This  is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009  (which we dont).  SUGGESTION What could be useful now is a differently-specified model designed to  forecast only the next 3 months, using auto-regressive or auto-regressive  error terms.  This model would be far more accurate in the near-term, and we  could include this information onto the front of this long-term model.  This  may be useful, despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time  buckets.    BACK-TESTING  All the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data  sample used (based mainly on 1990s new paradigm economy).    Hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele-conference;  your ideas on this would be appreciated.

This was conveyed by  Secretary (Power) during his meeting with Wade. In normal course, the  proposal was slated to be coming up for Cabinet in next few weeks. Keeping in  view the developments of DPC invoking State Guarantee, perhaps Cabinet has  hurried it up.   The exact proposal approved was - to allow foreign equity participation  through automatic route upto 100% for trading in power sector, subject to  prevailing laws.   Irrespective of urgency of this approval to us, the best thing is that we are  getting the approval without Draft Electricity Bill, 2001 being finalised. As  most of you are aware, initially the proposal was stalled at FIPB level  pending finalisation of Electricity Bill. Then it has gone to Group of  Ministers who had taken a positive approach and now the Cabinet has cleared  it.   Now FIPB either issue an approval to Enron LLC or advise us to avail  automatic route. We will have one of it, culminating great team work.

Please note that this URL should be used ONLY by you, and ONLY for this particular student.  It is linked directly to the students resume, and the processing occurs automatically and immediately. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- If it is inconvenient to use the URL, you may email your letter by replying to this email, but please help us out, if you use this option, by sending the letter as plain text only, not as a word processor file, without indent, and not as an attachment.  Also please make sure that your mailer includes the entire subject line in your reply message. If you use this option, please note that the processing of your letter will occur manually, and therefore may entail a considerable delay.  Our system will format the emailed text appropriately for display, unless you ask that it be treated as fixed-format. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- As a third option, if you prefer you may submit your letter as hard copy.  Please note that we discourage this approach, since electronic letters can be distributed far more effectively to the hiring managers.  However, if you wish, please see http://www.research.att.com/academic/Addresses.html for information on the proper address to use for various purposes.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Finally, a word about the position for which the student has applied:  This student has applied for a summer internship. We hire summer interns roughly from the third year of undergraduate work through graduate school.  The summer projects vary in level, depending on the student involved.  The students normally work in a one-on-one fashion with a member of staff on some facet of the ongoing research work in the lab, but they are expected to function somewhat independently after an initial period of familiarization with the work.  Accordingly, we are interested in information you may have as to the students adaptability, ability to learn new material, and to work effectively with minimal supervision.

Intelligence Press new multimedia research package provides a comprehensive look at all current activity on 458 storage fields with additional key information on 101 LNG facilities. Among them are 38 proposed natural gas storage fields and 15 storage expansion projects. Depleted fields capture the largest share of the proposed fields with 24, followed by aquifers with six, and salt domes and salt beds with four each. Altogether the proposed new fields account for about 329 Bcf in working capacity and 9.7 Bcf per day in deliverability.  Proposed and potential expansions represent an increase of about 100.5 Bcf of working capacity and 2.1 Bcf per day in deliverability. But these projects are just the tip of the iceberg. Regulatory changes, shifting natural gas flows and increases in demand due to growth in the economy and particularly in natural gas fired power generation are expected to cause significant additional storage growth in the next decade.

__label__Save	Re: Option Pricing Challenge Zimin,   to generalize your initial comment, for any process dS = Mu(S,t)*S*dt +  Sigma(S,t)*S*dz, the delta-hedging argument leads to the Black-Scholes PDE.   This is true for any arbitrary functions Mu and Sigma, and so includes GBM,  Mean Reversion, and others. There is no problem with this, because in the risk-neutral world, which is  what you enter if you can hedge, the drift of the actual process is irrelevant.  I believe your concern is that you would like to see a different option price  for Mean Reversion process.  This can only happen if the asset is not  hedgeable, and so the actual dynamics then need to be factored into the  option pricing.   If you assume that the underlying is a non-traded factor,  then the PDE will have to reflect the market price of risk, and the drift of  the actual process is then reflected in the PDE.

Hope you can give  me a convincing answer .  Zimin  ---------------------------------  In deriving BS differential equation, we assume the underlying follows GBM  ds= mu*s*dt + sigma*s*dz  where mu is the drift, sigma is the volatility, both can be a function of s.  Then we use delta hedging argument, we obtain the BS differential equation  for the option price, regardless of mu.    With the BS PDE and boundary condition, we can derive BS formula.  Fine. No  problem.  Question comes here.   Suppose the underlying is traded security and follows,  say, mean-reverting process  ds=beta(alpha-s)dt + sigma*s*dz  Apparantly, this SDE leads to a different probability distribution. However,  using the delta hedging argument, we still get the same BS differential equation, with the same boumdary  condition, we get the same BS formula.   Not fair !  From another angle, I can derive the distribution from the BS PDE for the  underlying, which is the lognormal distribution. My thinking is: can I drive the distribution for any SDE from the option PDE  ?  The answer should be yes, but got to be from a different PDE rather than BS PDE.  Then what we do about the  delta-hedging argument ?  Thanks.

__label__DontSave	Update on FERC Interconnection Meetings Overview Since many of you can not attend every meeting at FERC  regarding Generator Interconnection, we would like to provide you with a  few highlights of the past two weeks.    Interestingly, generators are finding that the Transmission  Owning (TOs) entities and ISOs have been less-combative than one may have  thought. This is largely due to Daniel Larcamps, Director of OMTR at FERC,  statement to the TOs that they can not hide behind the excuse that prior  practice and their Open Access Transmission Tariffs (OATT) prevent  them from granting many of the reasonable requests of the generators.  Larcamp said in no uncertain terms that the current OATTs are not hard- and-fast  anymore, instead, they are most likely going to be subject  to revisions per recent FERC orders.   The generator group is working very well together. We, the  Alliance of Energy Suppliers, are present and very involved in all of  the generator strategy sessions and industry meetings, in addition to  having Chuck Linderman of our Alliance on the process group. This  process group develops the issue lists for discussions and decides on  logistics and procedures for the upcoming meetings.  The Alliance has  also sponsored lunch for the generator group and continues to offer  our offices and conference rooms to any generators that may need office space  amenities during their extended visits here in Washington.     Procedural Schedule for Interconnection  Meetings 9:00AM       Llarger industry  session convenes to receive direction from FERC staff on the days topics  and process 9:15-9:30-    Break into sector caucuses,  i.e. Generators, Transmission Owners (TO), RTOs/ISOs, Transmission  Dependent                           Utilities (TDU), and Others. 10:30-12PM- All caucus groups come together to express desired  outcomes on certain issues and topics 12:00-1:30-    Caucus Group Working  Lunches 1:30-3:30-     Larger groups convene to  discuss individual caucus groups concerns and issues and attempt  consensus 3:45-4:45-     Individual caucus groups  meet again to discuss positions and find compromise or consensus  on issues  5:-5:30PM-    Plenary session to chart out next  steps and topics for next meeting.    Positive Meeting  Developments   Scope of Service  Generators were very successful in negotiating to receive an  option for generators to have three product levels of Interconnection Service.  Optionality was a paramount issue for generators. TOs conceded to offer the  following services:   (1) Energy Resource- based on the PJM study process  model (2) Network Resource- transmisison rights will be firm and  comparable to TOs network resources (3) Simple interconnection which allows for several options  to be chosen, but basic interconnection of the directly  assigned facility is the minimum.    Queuing TOs recognized that the queue positioning issues were  generator v. generator issues, so suggested that we offer suggestions to them as  to how to structure and administer the queue. Generators agreed and developed  the rights and timing it wished.    Functions of the Queues (1) identify order of studies (2) identifies timing of projects for developers (3) identifies and allocates costs responsibility   Limited Consensus TOs suggested, as generators had articulated that Best  practices #4 of te ANOPR be adopted as the minimum and build fro those  principles. So in essence (1) queue position for all interconnection requests be based  on the date the TP receives the request; ( (2) the Generator must meet reasonable milestones to retain  position in the queue;  (3) if a generator misses stipulated milestones, it will be  able to have a time period which to cure the deficiency. But if after  the reasonably agreeable time frame is exhausted, if  not cured, the generator may be at risk for losing its place in the queue;   (4) queue position may be at risk, if a generator makes  substantial material change. ( material changes must be further       defined by the  generators)   Scope of Studies and Interceonnection Agreement and  Procedures Outstanding Questions and Issues to be addressed in Later  Session (1) when is a generator included in the base case study or  modeling (2) when is a generator on the hook for costs (3) time line for when a generator receives a feasibility  study and that all developers should receives a feasibility study, unlike the  current practice where that is not the norm (4) if a generator cancels a project that had been allocated  costs for upgrades associated with its facilities, who pays for the necessary  upgrades if the generator drops out and does not complete the project?     Milestones Generators requested that milestones be tied into the  progression of a construction project. These milestones will include time lines  and schedules. The milestones will begin when a generator applies for  interconnection.    Note: TOs asked if generators could develop  the milestones since they viewed them as a generator-to-generator issue. As a  result, a group of generators joined a group of transmission owners to help  develop the milestone language.      Drafting Team A drafting team was formed that contains representatives from  each participatory group at the Interconnection meetings. This group  will draft consensus language for the final Interconnection document  submittal. This group takes day-by-day issues and attempts to fashion language  that represents broad consensus on these issues. The language proposals  are then vetted back through the individual caucus groups and voted on for  later approval by the entire industry group. (FERC distributed a voting guide  that helps categorize what is consensus and what is not)   Next Meetings Thanksgiving week- Nov 19-23. NO  MEETINGS There will be no FERC Interconnection meetings for this week.  However, the generators will  have a caucus  conference call on Monday Nov., 19 at 11AM to prepare for the following weeks  meetings.

The basic premise was to discuss and get  feedback from practitioners about the Research Project, and a PhD study which  is currently underway at Wharton. The discussions were very interesting -  especially as this was my first exposure to this area.   Examples of the discussions raised include why firms acquire new businesses instead of developing them in-house what degree of post-acquisition integration was optimal difficulties of US firms acquiring Euro/Asian high-tech companies how to value small high-tech firms how to quantify the success/failure of an acquisition  My feeling is that further work with them in this area would be beneficial to  Enron because it would help the development of the academic research and give  us first-hand access to the results. Plus it would enable us to learn from  the mistakes of others, through meeting practitioners at such workshops and  having greater access to the case studies. I guess it could also aid our  realignment within the high-tech/communication industry to be seen in such  studies.

__label__Save	Telephone Interview with the Houston Research Group Good morning Quentin:  Vince Kaminski and the Research Group would like to conduct a telephone interview with you sometime next week.  Considering the time difference  between Houston and Australia, it probably makes sense to try and schedule it very early in the morning your time, say 7:00 AM?  It would be 5:00 pm here in Houston.  How does next Wednesday or Thursday, (8/16 or 8/17) at 7:00 AM your time sound?  Also, please let me know if you want to be reached at home or work.  Thanks Quentin and have a great day!

__label__Save	Understanding Risk and Return of an Insurance Portfolio Hi Vince,  I am enclosing a report on my thoughts about risk and return behaviour of an   insurance portfolio. Your input on this will be very helpful.   I have given Vasant a copy of this report and am working with him towards  improving  this. In the mean time, I happened to mention this idea in a  meeting with David  Porter, Per Sekse, Brad Blesie and David Hoog and there  seems to be some  interest in understanding how this works. In fact, David  Hoog subsequently  reviewed this with me and suggested some changes. Those  changes have been included in this report.  The idea here is simple and just a starting point.  While it provides a broad  picture on how risk and return will behave at portfolio level,  I am hoping  to be able to relax some of the assumptions to get more realistic picture in  near future.  Looking forward to your input,  Sincerely,  Amitava Amitava Dhar amitava.dhar@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com Vasant Shanbhogue vasant.shanbhogue@enron.com

Based on your comments here would be my proposal  o63,500 basic salary -  o15K kickers for each of the 2 years - These are paid as a lump sum on each  anniversary guaranteed.  Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 -  this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus Increase the value of options to o60K  to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a  1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.    Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so  this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.    Let me know your thoughts.

I dont know the labor market  in London that well but here the market for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.  I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit. o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember  correctly). Steve has a much higher value to Enron than Anjam.

__label__Save	Softs in London Vince,  With regard to the softs curves development, I have been communicating with a  couple of folks in London.  The key contacts include James Willis (cocoa and  sugar broker) and Nigel Majury (coffee broker).  We had a conference call on  Thursday (Heather, Trena, Erin, James, Nigel, Frank Speight, Nelson) to  discuss data sources, data acquisition, priorities, and timelines.  A number  of data sources were identified (e.g., USDA, Intl Cocoa Organization, ED&F  Man, Landell-Mills Commodities, etc.) and both the Houston and London offices  have taken steps to obtain the information.  Curve development priorities  were adjusted as well.  Raw sugar remains the top priority; however, cocoa  replaces coffee in the softs importance hierarchy.  I suppose that this  results from our physical (or soon to be) positions in both markets.  The  timeline hasnt changed; however, adjustments will have to be made since we  havent yet acquired all of the necessary data for price modeling.  Moreover,  per our discussion this afternoon, additional thought/time will have to be  devoted to corn modeling to come up with an adequate hedging strategy.
