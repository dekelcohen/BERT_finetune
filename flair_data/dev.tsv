Thanks,  Jeff        Enron Energy Services  From:  Richard L Zdunkewicz                           05/03/2001 09:56 AM       To: James L Bouillion/Enron@EnronXGate, Paul Clayton/Enron@EnronXGate, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: James Harris/HOU/EES@EES, Jeff Forbis/HOU/EES@EES, Richard B Jones/HOU/EES@EES, Cheryl Brashier/HOU/EES@EES  Subject: Risk Profile and Liability Mitigation Product  Please find attached a Scope of Services document and a list of projects which have been implemented with current EES customers.  The Scope of Services document is designed to show the types of projects, operations and maintenance, and facilities management services that EESO typically offers to its customers based on their industry segment.  The projects and services offered are very similar across segments and customers, but their level of deployment varies significantly from segment to segment.    Certain segments were grouped together because the EESO offering would feature similar assets and services. SIC Codes were given for each segment to represent the types of customers that comprise each segment.  The list of projects represents general categories from which more specific projects will be tailored to fit the clients needs.  This project list represents assets that have been approved by the DSM Desk and was queried from PCCS. The Operations and Maintenance services can be applied to any energy-related assets and was compiled from term sheets and IAM.  Generally those activities have been limited to a few industrial outsourcing deals including Springs, Polaroid and recently Eli Lilly. Facilities Management is usually outsourced via IPT or through the adoption of existing vendor contracts and can involve repair and maintenance for all assets.   Generally this type of activity has been focused on the retail/real estate segment.        Cheryl, pls set up a meeting with Harris, Clayton, Bouillion, Jones and Kaminski to discuss this and an action plan to develop a liability mitigation product.  I will re-present the original product concept at the meeting.  Would like to see the meeting take place late next week.  Thanks.

__label__DontSave	New CERA Study - New Realities/New Risks: North American Power & Gas 2020 Mr. Vincent J. Kaminski Managing Director Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  Dear Mr. Kaminski:  Powerful new forces are transforming the North American gas and power industry, bringing considerable volatility and uncertainty to investment and strategy. Questions relating to prices, security, geopolitics, the global economy, and environmental concerns are forcing reconsideration of basic assumptions and plans.  To address these questions and concerns, Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) announces a timely new multiclient study, New Realities, New Risks: North American Power and Gas 2020.  In an online interview CERA Senior Director Lawrence J. Makovich presents a brief overview of major issues to be addressed in the study. To hear more information about the study, please access the interview on our website at http://www.cera.com/mc?c=2804&p=1044 .  Using CERAs scenario planning methodology, New Realities, New Risks will present plausible alternate paths to the future of power and gas markets in North America over the next 20 years. The Study will provide useful tools for evaluating corporate strategies and investments as well as an integrated assessment of gas and power market analyses.  The study will address key issues including *What levels of gas and power prices are sustainable? *How will the current wave of power plant and gas pipeline infrastructure development shift North American energy dynamics? *What opportunities, risks and challenges face those involved in the industry? *How will technological developments affect future gas and power markets? *Will the role of government expand or contract in the energy industry? *What will be the cost and value of increased energy security? *Who will be the winners and losers in each scenario?  For complete details of the study, including deliverables and proposed study content, please visit our website at http://www.cera.com/offerings/details/1,1504,CID2299,00.html.  In the traditional CERA format, the study will start with a kick-off workshop. Exclusively hosted for study participants(*), the kick-off workshop will take place in early January at a location to be announced.

__label__Save	Long-Term Volatility Curves Grant,  Can Research in Houston put together a comparison of the long-term volatility  curves for gas and power in North America and Europe?  Based on where Europe  is marked (especially for the UK), I think well find a significant  difference out beyond 10 years.  Fundamentally, it seems like the long-term  vol should be similar for a given commodity regardless of geographic location.  Has Research done any work on this in the past?  If not, we should study this  since long-term vol feeds into the VAR-based position limits.  Give me a call so we can discuss.

This list will be used to solicit the interest of  researchers and graduate students who would then work under our supervision.    While the details of how this effort will be organized are still largely up  in the air (list of financial institutions, reporting structure, financial  considerations, confidentiality agreements, exchange of seminars and short  courses, etc) we are making an attempt to define our common interests.  Such  areas are: Econophysical (e.g. market development; how weather expectations shape the  market; etc.) Product development (e.g. agriculture and weather; solar radiation and  telecommunications, the Jet stream and Airlines; etc.) Analytical/Mathematical/Simulation efforts (building a MC simulation for any  given problem might fall under here; working with incomplete data sheets/ways  for filling in data holes; etc.) Purely weather (e.g. a statistical analysis of the long term effects of solar  phenomena on weather would enter this category)  In light of the above and within the next couple of days,I would like to ask  you to provide me with problem statements within these areas that you have an  interest in and which might offer themselves to this kind of collaboration.   At this point, were brainstorming; we would thus be happy to have even the  sketchiest of ideas and have the weakest of expectations for well formulated  projects.

He is convinced that his skills and  Enron knowledge are valueable enough to warrant an assignment rather than a  local deal. Also, he was apparently told by Vince that it was impossible for  you to find a local hire for this role as you were not paying the market  rate.   Would you like to move further with this?

I felt that it would be useful to  bring Melanie Doyle, my HR rep, into the equation.  I met Melanie this  morning to discuss the issues with respect to taking up the offer in  Houston.  I explained that the interest for this opportunity is mutual, mine  from a career progression perspective and Houston Researchs to fill an  urgent need.  Melanie, having had experience with these transfers before, has  kindly agreed to help out from an HR perspective, probably involving some of  the London/Houston team that are usually responsible for these situations.  I  expect that you may receive a call from either Melanie or a foreign  assignment representative in the near future.  I would like to re-iterate my interest in the opportunity, but would like to  make a counter-proposal for the form of the contract; I would like to make  the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one-year assignment working  with Tanya, and then re-evaluate the situation at the end of the year in  terms a new role for me in Houston thereafter, subject to mutual agreement.   The alternative situation of resigning from Enron Europe and re-joining Enron  Corp is too dramatic and requires me to burn bridges and my return to Enron  Europe would be difficult.  Also, I would lose the valuable support  structures available to me in London.  The amount of any fixed costs  (flights, modest cargo, a few months of mortgage carrying cost) are entirely  reasonable, not excessive given my single status and not so great that they  justify making the contract a three year (local) one.  I would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1/2 years solid experience &  value-added at Enron Europe, the value of several million pounds I have  identified & justified to external auditors for Enron Europe this year and an  Excellent rating (my fourth making my 3 1/2 yr average rating also  Excellent), I could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal (i.e. my  existing Enron Europe salary & benefits package plus a reasonable one-off  allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses).

__label__Save	Benchmarking Study Sally,  I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request. They renewed their request for Enrons participation.  What is your view on this? Do you think the benefits of knowing whats going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the  project.  My recommendation is to forget it.

Have you discussed Enrons participation in the  project with your colleagues?  Here is a small sample set of metrics that were taken from a comprehensive  list of over 700 metrics.  The study group will decide which metrics to use.  With EEIs credibility and Teknecons technical expertise, we intend to  become the industry standard in benchmarking.  We would very much like to  have Enron participate in the study.  I would be happy to set up another meeting with you and your colleagues with  Peter Nance if you think that would be helpful.

__label__Save	Re: Response from Lenos Steve,  I shall E-mail you my standard real option spin presentation + plus a  presentation on Enron (for analysts). You can use a few slides to  introduce the company.  I would prefer not to disseminate the information about the  use of AMC. The  industry does not know about it yet and I consider it a very  powerful tool (given its flexibility).  I have the files on my laptop. I shall bring it to work to morrow and send it to you.  Please, remind me about it on Thursday (old age and the hectic pace here start showing up).  Vince       Steven Leppard 04/26/2000 05:09 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Response from Lenos  Vince  Lenos got back to me, and said hed prefer a high-level overview of real  options in Enron, perhaps using my notation to express the ideas.  He wants  me to keep away from the technicalities of my work.  Would you send me your (usual) powerpoint presentation on real options, and  Ill look at manipulating it to include my diagrams.  My own efforts to date  have been on fairly limited power plant modelling/asset development, and I  obviously dont have the high-level view you have.  This will ensure I get  the full range of real option type deals in my presentation.  If required I could present the real option problems I have analysed, namely: 1. Maintenance scheduling in power plant operation; 2. Gas storage; 3. Power plant asset development, which would include (1) as a sub-tree.  I will also need your advice on whether I can talk about the fact that we  prefer American Monte Carlo to build our trees.  I havent used AMC myself up  till now, Ive been carrying out static optimizations, with different price  curve scenarios being run through.  Im still working on selling the full stochastic dynamic programming approach  - people are just getting to the stage of accepting my deterministic DP, and  theyre still being supplied with useful products, as per my Real Options  Strategy document.

__label__Save	Jacob feedback Vince,  Chonawee and Tom Halliburton had  feedback about Jacob to me.  Toms feedback is what he does for Pros is actually too simple. Their so-called  trading system is actually a scheduling system.  My impression is that Jacob is good at selling himself, his knowledge of finance and derivatives is very limited.    Zimin     ---------------------- Forwarded by Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT on 04/11/2001 03:31 PM ---------------------------   Chonawee Supatgiat@ENRON 03/21/2001 07:28 PM To: Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Tom Halliburton/Corp/Enron@Enron  Subject: Jacob feedback   I asked Jacob two questions to check his basic knowledge. He answered correctly in the optimization question so I believe that he has a good foundation on his optimization skill. I have a doubt about his stochastic skill because he took only one course in Stochastic Processes and his previous models are simple deterministic models. If we had more interview time I would be able to check his stochastic and modeling skills.  He completely failed to answer the second question, which is to check his basic risk management skill. It is clear to me that he has a very weak background in finance and risk management. He does not understand the relationship between a discount rate and risk. He showed some weakness in annuity calculation.   In conclusion, I feel that he has good basic in optimization but a very weak background in finance. Based on his experiences, I have a doubt on his advance optimization skills, such as his stochastic skill and his ability to attack a complex optimization problem. I would recommend a second-round interview if he will be solving a complex-optimization problem.   -Chonawee Zimin Lu <Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT> zimin.lu@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski <Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT> vince.kaminski@enron.com Stinson Gibner <Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT> stinson.gibner@enron.com  Pinnamaneni Krishnarao <Pinnamaneni Krishnarao/HOU/ECT@ECT> pinnamaneni.krishnarao@enron.com

__label__Save	Re: London Research PRC Dale,  Thanks for the update. I fully concur with all the rankings. It seems things are going well with the Research Group in London and this is, to a very large extent, your contribution.  I think that Anjam has improved a lot. I dont think, however, that he can run the group in the future. Steve emerged as a natural leader and has overwhelming support in the organization.  Vince       Dale Surbey 06/15/2000 02:28 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: London Research PRC  Vince,  We had the PRC preranking for RAC and Research in London yesterday.  Heres  how everyone came out:  Steven - Superior:  No controversy here.  Steve received consistently strong  feedback (ranked as either superior or excellent in all categories).  The  only rough spot was teamwork, arising from the friction between Anjam and  himself.   Anjam - Excellent:  Anjam received rankings of Superiors or Excellents in all  categories.  Several reviewers commented that Anjams performance in the  areas of producing results in a timely manner and communication have  improved.  I felt the overall ranking of excellent was justified based on  this feedback, even though in terms of leadership I dont rate him high  enough to run the group here.  Stinsen provided the most insightful comment on Anjams performance:   Technically superior but lets his quest for a leadership position detract  from his overall performance.  On a related topic, Anjam has been taking random days off, typically on short  notice, so I suspect hes interviewing for a new job.  Given his inability to  work with Steven (especially in the future when Stephen heads the group),  this may be the best long-term solution.  Any thoughts?     Ben - Superior:  Another non-controversial ranking.  Ben received  consistently high marks from all the groups he supports, especially in the  area of non-technical skills.  I nominated Ben for promotion to Senior Specialist.  Even though he was  promoted at year end, hes taken on a lot of responsibility training Kirstee  and helping manage the other quant resources in Brians group.  Also, since  Kirstee was hired in at the same level as Ben, a mid-year promotion is  appropriate since hes effectively her supervisor.   Kirstee - Strong:  Only limited feedback in the 2 months shes been here.   High marks for technical/quantitative, strong in the soft skills.  I think  the strong rating is the right message for early in the game - gives her a  target for improvement for the rest of the year.   - Dale Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com enron.com Dale Surbey dale.surbey@enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research  Group, is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of  talent we have currently in London. Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  its time to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.   My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader,  highly respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy  level and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.  His promotion is likely to cause Anjams departure form Enron. I value  technical skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, dont think he is the  same caliber as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to  Houston for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a  sufficient incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has  greatly improved.  Please, let me know what you think.

Loss of demand due to economic weakness is exacerbated by the impact of the tragedy of September 11. Lower prices have already slowed drilling activity. Although ample storage levels will guard against last years peaks, gas prices will likely to continue to oscillate in the near term.  * The US gas supply rebound expected after record drilling rates is now unlikely. CERA expects only modest production increases for 2001 and a year- over-year decline for 2002.  * CERA has analyzed two paths for demand recovery depending on the severity and length of the economic downturn. Generally, the large overbuild of gas-fired generating plants and the recovery of industrial demand should cause much of the lost demand to return in 2002.   **end**  Follow above URL for complete CERA Watch (38 printed pages).

__label__Save	Re: Equity investment Fair Value in Turkey John,  It seems to me that using a risk-free rate is not appropriate. I shall  elaborate on my  position and send you a longer message this afternoon (my time).  Vince         Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe    From:  John Bottomley                           06/19/2000 05:55 AM    To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Dale Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Equity investment Fair Value in Turkey  Vince,  John Sherriff recommended that I contact you regarding an interesting (and  potentially contentious) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with  in London.  We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which  is currently seeking to IPO.  The issue we are discussing with RAC is which  discount rate (i.e., risk-free? and if so Turkish or US?) should we use to  value these options  First, some additional information.  Option characteristics: -- 116,000 options (representing 9% of the company) -- Term:  minimum of 3 years but possibly longer -- still being renegotiated -- Strike price:  20% below the upcoming IPO price (either priced in US$ or  Turkish Lire)  We currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $118.75  per option but 34,800 expire on July 15, 2000 with the remainder expiring on  December 15, 2000.  The companys investment bankers (ABN / AMRO Rothchilds)  are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at  $118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $300 million.  Due  to such a large valuation gap, they originally encouraged us to exercise  all of the options by the end of June (IPO target date in late Sept / early  Oct).  Our counter-proposal is to swap instrinsic value for time value by  repricing the options strike higher while extending their term.  We are currently negotiating with RAC the most appropriate discount rate to  use to value the options.  We are arguing that the US risk free is the most  appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the companys  historical senior debt cost (18%) is the more appropriate number to use  (although admit that this is not justifiable -- only a proxy)  A few key points: -- RAC is valuing the options via Crystal Ball simulations such that this to  be negotiated discount rate is used to calculate the PV of the future  options intrinsic value in 3 years  (i.e., for Black-Scholes, a higher discount rate yields a higher value but  the opposite is true using Crystal Ball simulation) -- The model simulates both an IPO / no IPO case and in the case of no IPO we  have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17% return -- The model assigns a 30% illiquidity discount -- In the simulated cases where the options are out-of-the-money, we  obviously do not exercise.  We understand that for Black-Scholes option valuation, one needs to be able  to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and  the risk free in order for the valuation to hold.  And here is where we reach  our difficulty:  since the company doesnt currently trade on a public market  and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities, RAC is arguing  that a US risk free is not appropriate to use.  Our argument is that the  non-IPO scenario, a 30% illiquidity discount and a US$ based option  volatility are already in the factored into the simulation.  As such, we feel  RACs approach is double counting.  If you managed to get through the above, your a patient man!  Ill give you a  call today or tomorrow after youve had a chance to digest the information.

VinceJKaminski <Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com> cc: Subject:?  Preface for book    Vince,  Hope you are well.  We  spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book, and?   you kindly offered that you would provide this. Is this still?  possible? We realise that you are extremely busy, so Chris and Les  went? ahead and wrote something, which is below, and if you want to  review, change or? re-write the preface, that would be very  appreciated. Let me know? what your thoughts   are.  Thanks, Julie (were getting  close)    Preface        One of our main  objectives in? writing Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management  has been to bring? together as many of the various approaches  for  the pricing and risk management? energy derivatives as possible, to  discuss  in-depth the models, and to show how? they relate to each  other. In this? way we hope  to help the reader to analyse the  different models, price a wide? range of  energy derivatives, or to  build a risk management system which uses a? consistent modelling  framework. We? believe that for practitioners this last point is   very important and we continue? to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk? management and giving  arbitrage opportunities  to your competitors by using? ad-hoc and  inconsistent models for different instruments and markets (see also OTHERS  WHO PROPOSE CONSISTENT? MODELS?). However, it is not? our wish to  concentrate on one particular model or  models, at the exclusion of?  the others because we believe that the choice should  rest with the  user? (although it will probably be clear from our discussions  the model(s) we? prefer). We therefore try and give? as clear  account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all the?  models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which? best suit their needs.    In order to meet our  objectives the? book is divided into 11 chapters. ? In chapter 1  we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to?  model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the?  book. In addition to introducing? the techniques that underlie the  Black-Scholes modelling framework we outline? the numerical techniques  of trinomial trees  and Monte Carlo simulation for? derivative pricing,  which are used throughout the book.    In Chapter 2 we discuss  the? analysis of spot energy prices. As? well as analysing  empirical price movements we propose a number of processes? that   can be used to model the prices. ? We look at the well-know process of  Geometric Brownian Motion as well as? mean reversion, stochastic  volatility and jump processes, discussing each and? showing how they  can be simulated and their parameters estimated.    Chapter 3,  written by Vince? Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of   Enron Corp., discusses volatility? estimation in energy commodity  markets. ? This chapter builds on the previous one. It examines in  detail the methods,?  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation  process assuming different? pricing models introduced in chapter 2.  ? Examples from crude, gas, and electricity markets are used to  illustrate? the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating  volatility.    Chapter 4 examines forward curves? in the  energy markets. Although? such  curves are well understood and  straight-forward in the most financial? markets, the difficulty of  storage in many energy markets leads to less well? defined  curves. In  this chapter we? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and  the building of forward? curves from market instruments. We?  outline the three  main approaches which have been applied to building  forward? curves in energy markets; the arbitrage approach, the  econometric approach, and? deriving analytical values by modelling  underlying stochastic factors.    Chapter 5 presents an overview  of? structures found in the energy derivative markets and discusses  their uses. Examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety  of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as  energy swaptions, compound  options, Asian options, barrier options, lookback  options, and ladder  options.    Chapter 6 investigates single and? multi-factor  models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard?  energy derivatives. Closed form? solutions for forward prices, forward  volatilities, and European option prices? both on the spot and  forwards are derived and presented for all the models in? this chapter  including a three factor, stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model.    Chapter 7 shows how the prices of? path dependent  and American style options  can be evaluated for the models in? Chapter  6. Simulation schemes are? developed for the evaluation of European  style options and applied to a variety? of  path dependent options. In  order? to price options which incorporate early   exercise opportunities, a trinomial? tree scheme is developed. This  tree? is built to  be consistent with the observed forward curve and  can be used to? price exotic  as well as standard European and American  style options.    Chapter 8 describes a methodology? for  valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market  observed? forward curve. The approach results? in a multi-factor  model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range  of energy forward curves. ? The user defined volatility structures can  be of an extremely general? form. Closed-form solutions are?  developed  for pricing standard European options, and efficient Monte  Carlo? schemes are presented for pricing exotic options. The chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of American style  options.    Chapter 9 focuses on the risk? management of  energy derivative positions. ?  In this chapter we discuss the  management of price risk for institutions? that trade options or other  derivatives and who are then faced with the problem?  of managing the  risk through time. ? We begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look? at extensions to gamma  hedging ?  illustrating the techniques using both spot and? forward  curve models. The general? model presented in Chapter 8 is ideally  suited to multi-factor hedging of a?  portfolio of energy derivatives  and this is also discussed.    Chapter 10 examines the key  risk? management concept of Value at Risk (VaR) applied to portfolios  containing? energy derivative products. After?  discussing the  concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs?  (volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated. We then  compare the fours major? methodologies for computing VaR; Delta,  Delta-gamma, historical simulation and? Monte-Carlo simulation,  applying each to the same portfolio  of energy? options. In this  chapter we also? look at testing the VaR estimates  for various  underlying energy market? variables.    Finally, in Chapter  11 we review? modelling approaches to credit risk. ? We  look in  detail at two quite different approaches, CreditMetrics (J. P. Morgan   (1997)) and? CreditRisk+ (Credit Suisse Financial? Products  (1997)) for which  detailed information is publicly available. Together  these provide an extensive set?  of tools with which to measure credit  risk. We present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy  derivatives.   Before? we begin we stress that the models and  methods we present in this  book are tools? which should be used with  the benefit of an understanding of how  both the ?tool?? and the market  works. The? techniques we describe are certainly  not ?magic wands?  which can be waved at? data and risk management problems to provide  instant and perfect solutions. To quote from the RiskMetrics   Technical Document ?? no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace  experience and professional judgement in managing risk.?. ? However,  the right tools,  correctly used make the job a lot?  easier!

__label__DontSave	ModReg for Argentina Folks, Heres some preliminary comments on the model we are using for Argentina.  Please correct me on any misunderstandings!  ModReg was written by consultants in Buenos Aires.  Documentation is available in Spanish only.  All data input is by means of text files, which require column orientated input, ie numbers must go into specific columns.  Detailed documentation has been provided specifying the data format for each file.  A weekly time step is used, with five load blocks per week, and a time horizon of one year, typically.  Each model run requires about 6 hours of processing.  ModReg is a modified version of the model used by the grid operator.  It is coded in Fortran and requires a CPLEX licence.  CPLEX is a powerful linear programming solver, developed by ILOG.  As the model is written in Fortran, the very good higher level interface to CPLEX is not available, so the code will have to access CPLEX at a lower level.  We have no documentation describing how the model algorithms.  Source code is not available at present.  ModReg appears to model around 30 busses and 71 lines.  Lines are characterised by from bus number, to bus number, maximum MW capacity in each direction, a percentage  loss factor, cost of transmission in each direction, and some other details.  Demand data is specified by week and load block for each bus.  Thermal plants have a heat rate and maintenance schedule specified, with the possibility of multiple fuels. I understand that hydro generation schedules for each historical inflow condition are an input to the model as they are calculated elsewhere.  From the above it appears that we have an unsatisfactory situation:  ModReg is difficult to use  we do not know in detail what the model does  we do not have documentation describing the algorithm   because source code is not available, we are completely dependent on the consultants.  If Enron is to continue modeling Argentina, we should as a minimum have a model that we understand, is reasonably easy to use, and is documented.  A graphical user interface is really needed to make ModReg easier to use.  Documentation is of course essential.  We should not use a model developed by consultants without documentation.  These steps would enable us to have more confidence in model results, and shortens the learning curve to enable more people to use model.    SDDP is likely to be a suitable replacement.  It would require reseroir inflow data rather than the calculated generations.  The regional loads etc could be modeled using the DC loadflow feature, with zero impedance lines.  Transmission losses in SDDP are a quadratic function of power flows, so some guesses would have to be made for line resistence values.  Setting up an SDDP model to represent all the aspects included in ModReg would be a time consuming job, that would require a good undertanding of the data for both models.  Some direct cut and paste of data from one models files to the others will be possible with a suitable column oriented text editor.  However the end result would be a model with the desirable attributes of documention, GUI interface, and flexible output.

__label__DontSave	EnTouch Newsletter BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  eSource eSource, Enrons research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.  Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enrons research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enrons research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs.   We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enrons eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the users desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.    As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like Industry Overviews and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.   IN THE NEWS  Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday.  In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year.  We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

__label__DontSave	Energy Institute Curriculum Dear Vince,   We have been working on the curriculum for some of the educational programs to be offered by the Energy Markets Institute that Arthur Warga and I discussed with you in the summer.  I am attaching (tentative) curricula for two important programs: (1) A graduate certificate in Energy Finance, (2) A 5-year BBA/MS program in Energy Finance.  Briefly, the certificate is a 5-course for-credit program that is available to people with sufficient basic background in finance, economics, statistics and mathematics.  This certificate includes coursework in accounting issues specific to the energy industry, basic aspects of energy sources and the organization and regulation of energy industry, forecasting and time-series econometric methodologies, basics of financial engineering and derivatives, real-options and project analysis as it applies to the energy industry, and energy derivatives and risk-managament.  The 5-year program is more ambitious. It seeks to provide a broad but rigorous curriculum for future energy industry professionals and managers. In the undergraduate component students take rigorous courses in math, probability and statistics, economics, chemistry and physics, and accounting and finance. This is conceived to be an elite and highly demanding program where students have to handle the more demanding courses in a variety of areas.  The 5th or graduate year of the program is given over to the energy certificate and additional graduate courses in finance and accounting.  I know you are extremely busy, but it would be very helpful to get your reaction (even at a broad level) to these programs and the type of courses that are envisaged.  We view these programs to potentially form the core of the educational activities of the Institute, but the next step would be to develop more specialized programs (of shorter duration) aimed at professionals already working on challenging problems in the industry. We are in the process of setting up the Institute and developing its governance and administrative structure. I will give you more details very shortly.  On another topic, Darrell Duffie (with whom I interacted with a lot during our student days at Stanford) will be coming to present a seminar at the Bauer College on January 10. We very much hope to see you and the Enron group there.  Finally, I hope that you and all of your loved ones and colleagues are as well as possible in light of the recent tragedies. We can only hope, pray and work to see that these senseless acts never again occur anywhere.   Best wishes,  Praveen    Praveen Kumar Chair and Professor of Finance C.T.

Knowledge may be the most important source of competitive advantage for a firm, but capturing the potential gains is a continuing challenge. Firms are filing patent applications at an unprecedented rate, while struggling to keep up with accelerating development cycles and shrinking lead times. Emerging technologies, changing legal interpretations and growing administrative burdens on the patent system are creating a new and unfamiliar context for the management of intellectual property. In response, firms are rethinking their strategies for realizing the rewards from their innovation. The Mack Center at the Wharton School has assembled thought leaders from leading companies, government and academia to address issues such as the following: - What strategies are firms using to create, protect and use their knowledge assets? - Do mechanisms such as secrecy, control of complementary assetsand lead time play an important role as a substitute or supplement for patent protection? - How is the U.S. patent and trademark office responding to the remarkable growth in patenting? Should they be protecting not only inventions but also ways of distributing and selling them? How should they deal with applications for patents on sequences of the human genome? - In a world where technology is developed and employed globally, what are the prospects for international harmonization of intellectual property laws and practice? - Are the patent office and the courts up to the task of creating and effectively enforcing clear intellectual property rights for emerging technologies?

__label__Save	Re: Progress Steve,  Thanks a lot. I think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards  understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem (for example, complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality) into the  code.  Regarding Tanyas attitude. Just a few points.   1. I dont think she has the skills to do the system administrators work and she does not have the necessary privileges. This explains why she keeps asking Winston for help.  Its not that the work is beneath her.  2. Some members of Tanyas team came to me complaining about Winston. He effectively told them to go away and work on the research projects and that he would take care of the IT issues. I dont think that its just  Tanyas issue, though I agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful.  3. The reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat  on  Tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and/or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run. They could not care less about the demarcation line between IT and Research. They also want Tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code.  The bottom line is that we are in full agreement: Tanya and Winston have to work as a team and I shall work on my end to make sure that  it happens. Credit is emerging as a critical issue for Enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail.  Vince     From: Stephen Stock/ENRON@enronXgate on 01/11/2001 08:23 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Progress   Vince,  I got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking  about some specific solutions to performance of IT systems... In particular  distributed processing. Also I heard that you had concerns about the use of  multiple languages etc....  Both of these sound like what I was discussing with you on previous  occasions... Do you feel the need to discuss these further?  The multi-language issue isnt really that much of an issue, as the current  system is 98% java right now. Although I am a big fan of C/C++(it is my main  development skill) , I am also very aware that Java is a much more evolved  and robust language. I had serious doubts about the performance, but Ive had  a review conducted, and the results are showing the Sun Unix implementation  to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than C/C++ because of something  they call Hot-Spot technology. (its an instruction caching technique, I  believe). The concerns I expressed to you, were really about how technical  people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively  meaningless metric like portability.  On the issue of distributed processing... the original review I had conducted  by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution, and as Zhiyong Wei  is already working on Global Valuation project, Winston is actively working  with Zhiyong to see if he can model the VaR architecture on that, and also to  find a common Valuation piece between the systems.  Id like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some  time over the next few days?  Also, I sat in on the Tanya / Winston meeting yesterday and as per our  discussion at the elevator, I attempted to help her argument by suggesting to  all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code... I.e.  Seperating research domain problems from IT problems.  She said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could  get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were. I asked her how she would  measure that, and she said she would instrument the code manually by  inserting timing elements at strategic points. I mentioned that a profiling  tool could probably do this job for her. Tanya again said that stepping  through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code, and that  studying documentation wasnt enough.   About 6 weeks ago, I commissioned a team to document the system down to  psuedo-code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon.  (in fact Ive asked for a draft copy to be given to Tanya right now), and  Winston is also working on a draft Research/IT working together document,  which will identify how the exchange of information takes place.  Tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated IT developer to do  all the environment setup for her, because she doesnt really want to have to  do that. I think that this is probably the root cause of the issue. The IT  guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good, as  it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her. She is  claiming that they are un-cooperative.... they are claiming that she  continually asks the same questions about set-up over and over again, and  doesnt seem to want to learn how to do it. Winston on the other hand, could  be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and  an IT issue and ask for help from research.  I think you Debbie and I need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely.  I have asked Tanya and Winston to go ahead and work very closely together  over the next few days....and Debbie Brackett and I will review their  progress on Friday.   In the meantime lll be looking at setting up a working test environment that  doesnt involve my main Quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer  term solution.

Typically, these are smaller events, with about 15-20  companies participating.   Twice each year, we invite approximately a dozen companies to join us at a  workshop in which we present our most recent research-in-progress from our  ongoing initiative on best practices and strategies in high technology  acquisitions.? This is part of our research activity and there is no  conference fee.   Our December 5 event will be of special value to senior decision makers  involved in planning or implementing growth through mergers and  acquisitions.? In case you are unable to attend or would like to include  another senior manager from the M&A sector, please feel free to forward this  invitation to a colleague.   An agenda for the symposium is attached, though we stress that the direction  of our discussions will be flexible and responsive to the interests of  participants.?

Our research includes developing a portfolio of in-depth case studies,  building a unique acquisitions database, and hosting semi-annual workshops  for industry practitioners.? These tools allow? us to perform rigorous  analysis to determine success factors in high technology mergers and  acquisitions.? Firms that have participated in our research process so far  include Cisco, Cable & Wireless, Hewlett Packard, Lucent, Symantec, and Xerox.   Timely Insights for Company Decision-Makers.? One of the most unique aspects  of this project is the reporting of research in progress, to give industry  decision makers access to the insights from our research as they are  revealed.? To test and refine our findings, we host an ongoing series of  workshops that bring together practitioners from some of the most experienced  acquirers in the high tech arena, and academicians whose research interests  converge on the role of acquisitions in technology-based competition.   Our next workshop on December 5 will be the third in the series.? Prior  events were held in December 1999 at Wharton and June 2000 at INSEAD in  Paris, France. (Reports of these events are available on the ET website:  http://emertech.wharton.upenn.edu).   Objectives.? Our objective is to build a community of practice around the  complex phenomenon of managing acquisitions in high-tech environments.? A  major goal is to identify and validate new best practices and winning  strategies in mergers and acquisitions.? Most of our focus involves issues of  value and concern to large multinational corporations.? We are particularly  interested in how mergers and acquisitions are pursued as part of a companys  GROWTH STRATEGY.   Research Team.? The research team on this initiative includes:?

__label__Save	Enron and The New Economy Value Research Lab Gentlemen:  Enron is exploring the possibility of becoming involved in a research  endeavor called the New Economy Value Research Lab. The Lab is the result of  a joint effort between MITs Sloan School of Management and Arthur Andersen  (AA). Its purpose is to develop quantitative valuations of the intangible  assets Wall Street finds increasingly important in the New Economy (Business  Week, 2/7/00). Clearly, as Enron continues to shift from a hard asset to  intangible asset based organization, the question of how to accurately and  appropriate measure and value our intangible assets is becoming increasingly  important.  Last week, Steve Kean, Vince Kaminski, Marie Hejka, and myself met with a  team from AA, the Deputy Dean of the Sloan School, and MITs lead  accounting/finance professor to discuss the intent of the Lab, expected  outcomes, and how Enron may be involved. Post that meeting, the decision was  made to continue to explore participation in the Lab. Enron now needs to 1)  define our corporate measurement and valuation process needs, and 2) identify  value attributes important to Enron and the industries in which we operate.  Once defined, a follow up meeting will be held with MIT and next steps will  be determined.  Your expertise and assistance could significantly impact the inputs and  outcomes of these next steps. Please schedule time on Tuesday August 1 from   2:00 to 3:30 to attend the next meeting, during which we will begin to  identify needs and define value attributes. Location will be EB 49c4. Please  notify me if you are unable to attend.  Lastly, to assist with preparation for this meeting, I am attaching notes  from a recently published book entitled  Cracking the Value Code: How  Businesses Are Creating Wealth in the New Economy (May 2000, Boulton, Libert,  Samek - Arthur Andersen).    Should you like more information on the Lab, previous meeting, book or other,  please feel free to contact me.  I look forward to meeting you.

In its current form the analysis is quite simple. A stochasitic (fast or slow, with abritrary periods) is computed from the stocks data (see below for a more detailed description). Next, the stock data searched for Japanese Candlestick patterns (see below).  The actual analysis consists of simulating several years of trading (here ten years). Each is stochastic and candlestick data is examined. If the days candlestick is a hammer and the %k is above a pre-defined value, a buy signal is triggered. Likewise, if the days candlestick is a hanging man and the %k is below a second pre-defined value, a sell signal is triggered. When simulating a buy, a long position of a constant number of shares is opened if long positions already exist or if no positions exist. If there are open short positions, each of these is closed. Likewise, when simulating a sell, a short position of the same constant number of shares is opened if short positions already exist or if no positions exist. If there are open long positions, each of these is closed. When closing a position, the rate-of-return and annualize rate-of-return are calculated. For both long and short positions:                             sale cost - purchase cost                      RoR = -------------------------                                 purchase cost (a better method is needed for shorts)  and,                                                365                                       --------------------                                       Duration of Position           Annualized RoR = (RoR + 1.0)                     - 1.0  Stochastics:             (Todays Close - Lowest Low for kN Periods) %k = ---------------------------------------------------------      Highest High for kN Periods - Lowest Low for kN Periods) %p = Simple Moving Average of %k for pN Periods       (Where the lowest low is chosen from amongst the lows       field and the highest high is chosen from amongst the       high field.)  This is a fast-stochastic. When computing a slow stochastic, %k is replaced with its 3-day Simple Moving Average. %p is then calculated from this value.   Japanese Candlesticks: The application currently searches the data for the Hanging Man and Hammer patterns. A Hanging Man is defined as very short top-shadow, medium body, and long bottom-shadow. The ratios are adjustable. A Hammer is a Hanging Man where the days close is higher than the open.    -- Vince Kaminski vincek@cs.stanford.edu VKaminski@aol.com@ENRON vkaminski@aol.com aol.com Kaminski j.kaminski@enron.com

By Jeb Bolding  In October I talked about Relera, which at that time, announced that it was getting out of the managed-services business. Before it made the announcement I visited its Internet data center in Denver and what comes to my mind when I think about the discussion I had with its CEO, and my impression of the facilities is one word: scale.  Everything was about having the best partners, the biggest data center, massive systems redundancy rates, etc. No doubt, there is a place for that corporate mentality, and Releras focus on scale should be a comfort to many enterprise companies. Relera may have just been unfortunate with its timing in the market and it may yet be successful with its focus.  As a counterpoint, yesterday I visited another local Internet data center provider, Inflow. Like Relera, Inflow is headquartered in Denver, and like Relera, it is focused at second-tier cities such as Nashville and Minneapolis, though it does have some first-tier city locations.  The similarities, in my opinion, end there. Inflows corporate esprit de corps seems to revolve around smaller is better.  As an example, the data centers are smaller, somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 square feet. Not only does this bring data center profitability sooner based upon allocated space, but it also gives, in the words of Inflow executives, a more personal touch to the relationship between the data-center managers and Inflows customers.  Further to this point, instead of effectively building its own substations, Inflow ensures that each of its data centers (there are three in Denver) are located on different power grids. While this may not put you in complete control over your own destiny, its a reasonable, and cost-efficient solution based upon the statistical likelihood of a disaster.  While Inflows costs are considerably less, the features of its facilities do not appear to be diminished.  All data centers are mirror images of one another (other than the square footage), so that a customer walking into a Nashville facility will be just as at home in a Denver center.  All the services, from simple co-location, to managed security services and monitoring, are replicated similarly across the various locations.  And your single operational account representative is your focal service point regardless of how many Inflow data centers youre in. Management is fully integrated between the data centers so that your customer representative does not have to be local to your issues in order to solve them.  No doubt, there is a place in the business world for Relera and Inflow. Inflow may have just lucked out that its focus on costs will help the company better weather a long downturn.  _______________________________________________________________ To contact Jeb Bolding:  Jeb Bolding is senior consultant with Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder, Colo., an analyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on enterprise management.

__label__DontSave	Update on FERC Interconnection Meetings Overview Since many of you can not attend every meeting at FERC  regarding Generator Interconnection, we would like to provide you with a  few highlights of the past two weeks.    Interestingly, generators are finding that the Transmission  Owning (TOs) entities and ISOs have been less-combative than one may have  thought. This is largely due to Daniel Larcamps, Director of OMTR at FERC,  statement to the TOs that they can not hide behind the excuse that prior  practice and their Open Access Transmission Tariffs (OATT) prevent  them from granting many of the reasonable requests of the generators.  Larcamp said in no uncertain terms that the current OATTs are not hard- and-fast  anymore, instead, they are most likely going to be subject  to revisions per recent FERC orders.   The generator group is working very well together. We, the  Alliance of Energy Suppliers, are present and very involved in all of  the generator strategy sessions and industry meetings, in addition to  having Chuck Linderman of our Alliance on the process group. This  process group develops the issue lists for discussions and decides on  logistics and procedures for the upcoming meetings.  The Alliance has  also sponsored lunch for the generator group and continues to offer  our offices and conference rooms to any generators that may need office space  amenities during their extended visits here in Washington.     Procedural Schedule for Interconnection  Meetings 9:00AM       Llarger industry  session convenes to receive direction from FERC staff on the days topics  and process 9:15-9:30-    Break into sector caucuses,  i.e. Generators, Transmission Owners (TO), RTOs/ISOs, Transmission  Dependent                           Utilities (TDU), and Others. 10:30-12PM- All caucus groups come together to express desired  outcomes on certain issues and topics 12:00-1:30-    Caucus Group Working  Lunches 1:30-3:30-     Larger groups convene to  discuss individual caucus groups concerns and issues and attempt  consensus 3:45-4:45-     Individual caucus groups  meet again to discuss positions and find compromise or consensus  on issues  5:-5:30PM-    Plenary session to chart out next  steps and topics for next meeting.    Positive Meeting  Developments   Scope of Service  Generators were very successful in negotiating to receive an  option for generators to have three product levels of Interconnection Service.  Optionality was a paramount issue for generators. TOs conceded to offer the  following services:   (1) Energy Resource- based on the PJM study process  model (2) Network Resource- transmisison rights will be firm and  comparable to TOs network resources (3) Simple interconnection which allows for several options  to be chosen, but basic interconnection of the directly  assigned facility is the minimum.    Queuing TOs recognized that the queue positioning issues were  generator v. generator issues, so suggested that we offer suggestions to them as  to how to structure and administer the queue. Generators agreed and developed  the rights and timing it wished.    Functions of the Queues (1) identify order of studies (2) identifies timing of projects for developers (3) identifies and allocates costs responsibility   Limited Consensus TOs suggested, as generators had articulated that Best  practices #4 of te ANOPR be adopted as the minimum and build fro those  principles. So in essence (1) queue position for all interconnection requests be based  on the date the TP receives the request; ( (2) the Generator must meet reasonable milestones to retain  position in the queue;  (3) if a generator misses stipulated milestones, it will be  able to have a time period which to cure the deficiency. But if after  the reasonably agreeable time frame is exhausted, if  not cured, the generator may be at risk for losing its place in the queue;   (4) queue position may be at risk, if a generator makes  substantial material change. ( material changes must be further       defined by the  generators)   Scope of Studies and Interceonnection Agreement and  Procedures Outstanding Questions and Issues to be addressed in Later  Session (1) when is a generator included in the base case study or  modeling (2) when is a generator on the hook for costs (3) time line for when a generator receives a feasibility  study and that all developers should receives a feasibility study, unlike the  current practice where that is not the norm (4) if a generator cancels a project that had been allocated  costs for upgrades associated with its facilities, who pays for the necessary  upgrades if the generator drops out and does not complete the project?     Milestones Generators requested that milestones be tied into the  progression of a construction project. These milestones will include time lines  and schedules. The milestones will begin when a generator applies for  interconnection.    Note: TOs asked if generators could develop  the milestones since they viewed them as a generator-to-generator issue. As a  result, a group of generators joined a group of transmission owners to help  develop the milestone language.      Drafting Team A drafting team was formed that contains representatives from  each participatory group at the Interconnection meetings. This group  will draft consensus language for the final Interconnection document  submittal. This group takes day-by-day issues and attempts to fashion language  that represents broad consensus on these issues. The language proposals  are then vetted back through the individual caucus groups and voted on for  later approval by the entire industry group. (FERC distributed a voting guide  that helps categorize what is consensus and what is not)   Next Meetings Thanksgiving week- Nov 19-23. NO  MEETINGS There will be no FERC Interconnection meetings for this week.  However, the generators will  have a caucus  conference call on Monday Nov., 19 at 11AM to prepare for the following weeks  meetings.

__label__Save	New Update on PPI Model for Inflation Book - Final Version Dear all,  Attached is Anjams reasoning and final version of the UK PPI PLLU model.   The UK Inflation Books main exposure is to two PPI indexes - the PLLU and  the DZCV through year 2010. Both are PPI Output indexes with very comparable  baskets. The only significant difference between the two is the presence of  energy in the PLLU (7.6%). The model in use escalates the two indexes by the  same factors. However, with the energy price fluctuations in recent years  different models for the two indexes would reflect better the nature of their  drivers. Anjam concentrated on the PLLU index first and he will shortly  construct one for the DZCV based on the same methodology, but without the  Brent Crude curve.   The new model achieves the two main objectives of the PPI curve: it is  significantly more robust and stable than the existing one, and it is  considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients. This will result in us  having more confidence in our monthly P&L as well as less fluctuations.   Best regards,  Martina  x34327      Anjam Ahmad 10/03/2000 11:59 To: Martina Angelova/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: New Update on PPI Model for Inflation Book  Dear all,  I followed up on the suggestions of happening babe at the conference call as  follows:-  1) USE LESS DATA  Unfortunately, kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less  robust, in fact dramatically so, and so eliminates the possibility of using  less data.  The model tested was the RPI(month+15) & Deviations from  long-term average for Brent Crude.  The r-squared and F-statistic collapsed  by eliminating the first 12 months of data.  2) DEVIATIONS IN CRUDE VARIABLE  Shifting the crude explanatory variable backwards and forward by 3 and 6  months did not alter the model goodness-of-fit parameters dramatically and so  my suggestion is that we stick with the following model:  PLLU[t] = a.RPI[t] + b.RPI[t+15] + c.BrentCrudeDeviations[t] + Constant  3) TESTING MODEL WITH SINE WAVE  To gauge the response of the model to wildly-varying RPI forward curve, a  sine wave of period 3 years for RPI was input into the PPI model.  The result  was as expected; PPI pre-empts the moves in RPI by about 8 months.  The  magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced.  This shows that if we had  more detail in our RPI forward curve, then the PPI model would reflect those  peaks and humps adequately.    CONCLUSION  I therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates RPI, RPI[t+15]  and deviations of Brent Crude from long-term average.  The new model is  plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old PPI which is  depicted in blue.    Please note that all this analysis only applies to PLLU, and that a separate  study will be needed for the DZCV PPI index.  Regards,  Anjam x35383  ---------------------- Forwarded by Anjam Ahmad/LON/ECT on 09/03/2000 16:52  ---------------------------   Anjam Ahmad 08/03/2000 14:03 To: Martina Angelova/LON/ECT@ECT, Harry Arora/HOU/ECT@ECT, Maureen  Raymond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT, Farouk Lalji/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Trena McFarland/LON/ECT@ECT, Dale Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT, Stinson  Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Leandro  Ibasco/Corp/Enron@Enron   Subject: Update on PPI Model for Inflation Book  Dear all,  We thought it might be useful to incorporate Brent crude as an explanatory  variable for PPI; it was found that deviations of Dated Brent Crude from the  long-term average of $18.80 was the best form of the variable to use (for  predictions the Brent forward curve produced by the Global Products Group is  used).  The three new equations developed were:-  PLLU(t) = a.RPI(t) + b.RPI(t+N) + c.(DatedBrentCrude - 18.8) + constant,  where N is 14,15 or 16 [REDDISH CURVES] r-squared approx 0.49 F-stat approx 32  The chart below shows what our projected PLLU curve would be given this  equation, and also the three best relations from before which were based upon  current and future RPI:  PLLU(t) = a.RPI(t) + b.RPI(t+N) + constant, where N is 14,15 or 16 [GREENISH CURVES] r-squared approx 0.47 F-stat approx 45  COMPARISON OF MODELS As you can see, the two equations differ in the very short-term and very  long-term; the inclusion of deviations of Brent Crude leads to short-term  predictions of 3.0% to 3.2% over the next six months.  The greenish curves  predict PLLU in the range of 2.5% to 2.8% over the next six months.  The curves are then very similar until 2009, when the models including crude  break-away to the upside, relative to the falling RPI curve.  The model based  purely on RPI hugs the RPI curve much more closely in the longer term.  This  is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009  (which we dont).  SUGGESTION What could be useful now is a differently-specified model designed to  forecast only the next 3 months, using auto-regressive or auto-regressive  error terms.  This model would be far more accurate in the near-term, and we  could include this information onto the front of this long-term model.  This  may be useful, despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time  buckets.    BACK-TESTING  All the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data  sample used (based mainly on 1990s new paradigm economy).    Hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele-conference;  your ideas on this would be appreciated.

__label__Save	transport model Andy,  The scale effect in the transport model can be explained.   I use a European option to do the illustration.  I raise the underlying and strike price by the same amount, use the fuel  percentage to adjust the strike. The net result is the intrinsic value decreases as the level goes up.  If the fuel percentage is not very high, the option premium actually  increases with the level, although the intrinsic value decreases.    If the fuel percentage is very high (>8%), then we see a decreasing option  price.  In the transport deal, fuel change is often below 5%, so you will not see a  decreasing spread option price when NYMEX moves up.  So I think the transport model still does what it  should do.

Development of SDDP was originally done on a World Bank contract to compare  the benefits of new generation and transmission system interconnections in  Central America.  It has since found much wider application.  The code runs  on a PC, and is licensed to a number of consultants, power companies, etc.   While I was with ECNZ in Wellington, New Zealand, we purchased a copy around  1994.  The model works with weekly or monthly time steps, with a time horizon of  from 1 to 10 years, for mid to long range planning of hydro thermal power  systems.  It represents loads in each period as from one to five load blocks,  so it is not a chronological model.  This type of model can not handle  thermal plant ramp rates and similar chronological system constraints.  Im  not sure how important that would be to you.  The optimization phase of the  model takes into account hydrological uncertainty using a form of stochastic  dynamic programming with sampling.  This phase sets up a function for water  value in each large reservoir in the system.  The simulation phase uses a  number of hydrological outcomes to collect statistics on how the system would  operate.  The water values can be used with the short term optimization mode  of SDDP or in some other more detailed short term optimization model.  Most constraints found in hydro systems can be modelled.  Many transmission  constraints can be modelled.  A DC load flow option can be used to determine  bus nodal prices.  A Visual Basic user interface is provided which reads and writes text files.  If youd like to know more about SDDP, you could call me here in Houston.

__label__DontSave	RE: longitude Thank you, Joe. If they include combinatorial bids then it would be a much more complicated system. I think everything comes down to liquidity. If they have enough volume, then it will attract even more bidders because the bidders do not have to think too much about the fair price because they will always get the lowest successful price anyway. If there is small volume, then it will become harder for the bidders to decide on optimal bidding strategy. Personally I think this system will work because there are many speculators out there who want to play this kind of games.  :-)  -Chonawee   -----Original Message----- From:  Hrgovcic, Joseph   Sent: Saturday, November 03, 2001 4:33 PM To: Supatgiat, Chonawee; Bharati, Rakesh; Shanbhogue, Vasant; Kaminski, Vince J Subject: RE: longitude  Chonawee,   Good work. Id like to add a few observations. Regarding your comment about not being able to buy straddles:  Longitude informed us that an upcoming implementation (that is actually in place now but has not been made available so as not to complicate the initial auctions). The new implementation allows packages of digital spreads to be bought and sold as one instrument, resulting in terraced payout functions that approximate true call and put (and presumably collar and straddle) payouts. Even so, the structures will remain largely digital in nature; therefore, they will be rather dirty hedges for traditional calls and puts regardless of how one packages them   As far as getting a bad price, the auctions here are indeed Dutch auctions, but I believe that the limit orders address this issue -- they assure a given payout ratio. Certainly there is no guarantee that any of the amount laid down by a participant will be placed, which is another problem for hedgers. (Then again, a traditional hedger who asks too much for his offsetting transaction is also unlikely to meet with success.)   Lastly, with regard to the last paragraph on publishing tentative prices, it is left up to to the discretion of market maker to decide how much of the auctions internal operations (including tentative prices) is posted, but remember that the auction is intended to last only a few hours at a time, yet again constraining the auctions suitability for hedging (admittedly, there would likely be several auctions throughout the life-cycle of the underlying index).

(Vince, I already gave you a hardcopy of it earlier.. in case you wants a softcopy)  As Vasant pointed out, it looks like they already did the real-time tentative prices posting in their system. So now hedgers can participate in the auctions. I still feel that the system will attract speculators more.

__label__Save	Energy Derivatives Book Hi Vince,  It was good to speak to you and Grant the other day.  Plese find attached a block of 3 chapters that are basically the middle of the book. This should give you an idea at the level it is pitched - although these are probably some of the the most technical of the chapters. Julie who works for us will be getting in contact with you soon to chase you up on your chapter!  Ive asked Julie to have a chat to you about a couple of other things at the same time. I hope this is OK with you. Julie and I will be making a trip thru Houston around the third week of February to try and visit some energy companies. Its mainly a fact finding trip to see what the energy companies are doing and how we might be able to make use of our skills in a commercial sense. Would you recommend any people we should talk too? Also we will be running a course on energy derivatives in Houston at the end of March following the success of the course in New York last year and want to advertise this. Do you know of people who would be interested in such a course?  We are currently putting together promotional material for the book - can you please let Julie know how you and Grant would like to be advertised - your official positions, etc.  Best regards, and I look forward to reading your chapter soon.

__label__Save	EOL WTI Historical Trade Simulation - more profitable trading strategy Please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue, which contains some  typos.    Greg and John,  I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of  trades ( keeping the  total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially  because in a trending market we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose  market move from $30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL and the half bid-offer spread  is $1 for simplicity, we take 5  trades of short positions, the total MTM for that day is  (-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$150,000 and total trading  volume is 50,000 BBL short.  If per trade volume is 50,000 BBL, we take one  trade, the total MTM is  -5*50,000= -$250,000.   Thus the net difference between the two trading  strategies is $10,000 for that particular day.  Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the  number of trades, we can be more profitable as a market maker.    I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per  trade volume of 30,000 BBL. I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades  by factor of 3.  Almost in all cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked Change for  dollar amount change in millions.  Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

__label__Save	Dhabol Jeff,  We shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from Sandeep with the  numbers you have  requested.  What follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on  the power situation in India published by The Financial Times.   The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting  millions of people. One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of  output lost due  to  power shortages. It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost  of power produced by the Dhabol plant (expensive as it may be). The power cut affected 230  million people.  The second article is Enron specific.  Vince                                            ASIA-PACIFIC: Power failure hits north India                       Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001                      By ANGUS DONALD                       Tens of millions of people were left without electricity  in northern India                      yesterday after a power grid breakdown.                        Electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and  most parts of the                      capital New Delhi, with 60 to 70 per cent of supply  expected to be restored                      by the end of the day, according to power grid  officials.                        The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry  (Assocham), a                      leading business organisation, expressed deep concern  and called for a                      mechanism to prevent future disruption that could  cripple the economy.                        The power failure across eight Indian states, including  New Delhi, disrupted                      train services, water supplies and the telephone network  and forced                      hospitals to switch to emergency generators.                        The fault occurred on the Northern Grid, which provides  electricity for 226m                      people, and affected the states of Delhi, Haryana,  Punjab, Uttar Pradesh,                      Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu  and Kashmir.                        A breakdown at a sub-station in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh,  Indias most                      populous state, caused an overload of power on other  lines, which then                      failed as well.                        Trains stopped running for most of the day and signals  systems were                      damaged. New Delhi international airport was also  slightly affected before                      its own power supply could be engaged.                        We will probe into the reasons for the failure. It is  most likely to be a                      technical failure, but we will investigate why it  happened, Suresh Prabhu,                      the power minister, was quoted as saying by Press Trust  of India.                        India suffers regularly from power problems because of  lack of funding to                      upgrade infrastructure. Theft of supplies is also a big  problem. Thirty per                      cent of the countrys electricity is stolen, according  to analysts. In New                      Delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen.                        Two years ago, a power failure blacked out Uttar Pradesh  and Delhi for                      hours.                        Assocham issued a statement, saying that increasing  industrial demand                      would exacerbate the problems already faced by Indias  inefficient power                      sector. The slow progress, particularly in  strengthening the transmission                      and distribution system, and ever increasing theft will  contribute to                      worsening the power supply situation further.

Its myth and reality offensive in local newspapers  follows the west Indian                      state of Maharashtras decision to review the tariff it  pays the Texas-based                      company, whose Dollars 2.2bn electricity generating  plant at Dabhol is                      Indias biggest single foreign investment.                        Maharashtras tariff has more than doubled since 1993  and is three times                      greater than that charged by other independent power  producers (IPPs).                      The tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the  rupee against the                      dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha  fuel. The state also pays                      a fixed capacity charge of Rs970m (Dollars 21m) a month,  reflecting the                      huge project cost and, controversially, irrespective of  consumption.                        A showdown looks inevitable, reminiscent of a clash six  years ago that                      damaged Indias appeal to foreign investors. A former  official of the World                      Bank, which has criticised the deal, says Enron is  emerging as the East                      India Company of the 21st century - a reference to the  British trader that                      colonised key areas of the Indian economy in the 19th  century.                        The stand-off is the latest blot on Indias power  sector. The UKs PowerGen                      and Cogentrix of the US have quit India recently,  frustrated by long approval                      procedures, inadequate payments mechanisms or because of  higher                      returns elsewhere.                        India has lost time and opportunity and has driven  returns down by six                      percentage points, says Gerry Grove-White, former India  general manager                      of PowerGen, which has sold its 655MW plant in Gujarat  to China Light &                      Power of Hong Kong.                        Indias national plan for the five years to 2002 says  generating capacity                      must rise by 40,000MW to about 120,000MW. But since  1992, IPPs have                      added only 3,000MW and 2,500MW remains under  construction. This is                      insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8  per cent economic                      growth.                        Enron was a bellwether of Indias liberalisation,  winning fast-track project                      approval in the early 1990s. Phase 1, a 740MW plant  fuelled by expensive                      naphtha came on stream in May 1999, and phase 2, a  Dollars 1.87bn plant                      of 1,624MW capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied  natural gas (LNG),                      will be completed this year. Only two of seven other  fast-track proposals                      have achieved financial closure.                        From the outset Enron encountered attacks, culminating  in Maharashtras                      then nationalist government cancelling the project  before renegotiating                      terms no less onerous. Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister  of the successor                      government, says the power purchase agreement is  unaffordable.                        Enron, whose attackers also include cultural  chauvinists, wants to maintain                      good political relations in a hostile but lucrative  environment. Enron views                      India as a testing ground for its evolution from a  traditional manager of                      power plants to a broad-based trader of commodities,  such as energy, gas                      and bandwidth.                        To support these ambitions Enron hopes to trade energy  between power                      surplus and deficit states, once legislation is passed  this year. It is building                      an LNG terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural  gas. And it is                      laying a 15,000km fibre-optic network to trade bandwidth  space in a country                      desperately short of this new economy commodity.                        In any event, Enron believes it has a watertight  contract. It is supported by                      many that believe any subversion of the contract would  confirm investor                      perception of Maharashtra, Indias financial and  industrial hub, as an                      unreliable destination for investment.                        Mr Deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his  predecessor, which                      threatened to dump Dabhol into the Arabian Sea - is  under pressure from                      radical members of his wobbly coalition. But his options  are limited.                      Scrapping the project would be ruinous for an  economically troubled state                      that would have to compensate shareholders.                        Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the local utility  and Enrons main                      client, is obliged to dispatch or off-take 90 per cent  of Dabhols output. Yet                      MSEB has never honoured these guarantees. Its off-take  has averaged 60                      per cent since the plant opened and, in effect, MSEB has  been paying a lot                      more while consuming a lot less power.                        One reason off-take is low is because the states tough  new regulator has                      told MSEB to buy from cheaper sources. Enron says the  tariff would be                      Rs4.02/kWh if MSEBs off-take averaged 90 per cent. But  with off-take a                      third lower, the average tariff is Rs4.94 per unit, and  often higher. In                      October, the tariff was Rs6.91 per unit, when off-take  was about 49 per                      cent. Enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2,  run on cheaper                      LNG, starts.                        These cost pressures have forced MSEB to take up only  half of a 30 per                      cent equity option in phase 2. Enron has acquired the  balance and                      mandated bankers to find a buyer.                        Enrons difficulties have undermined the appeal of IPPs,  which have failed to                      deliver the flood of investments. Potential IPPs feared  they would never be                      paid by state generating boards that have become a  byword for corrupt                      management of power.                        Reform of state electricity boards, whose uneconomic  pricing means                      industrial users subsidise poor farmers, as well as  transmission and                      distribution (T&D) services to check huge theft and  technical losses, is                      overdue. Given the limited resources, money would be  better spent on T&D                      rather than on new plant, says Oliver Blackaby,  managing director of N M                      Rothschild in India, which is advising Karnataka on the  privatisation of its                      distribution network.                        For the moment, attention is fixed on Enrons ability to  satisfy the                      competing interests of investors and clients. As Sanjay  Bhatnagar, chief                      executive officer of Enron India, said in a recent trade  magazine, one of the                      key lessons learned from phase 2 is having flexibility  to deal with                      externalities.

__label__Save	Price Caps ---------------------- Forwarded by Vladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT on 11/01/2000  03:39 PM ---------------------------          From:  Tim Belden                           10/27/2000 05:40 PM    To: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron, Dave Delainey, Mike Swerzbin/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Alonso/PDX/ECT@ECT,  Mark Fischer/PDX/ECT@ECT, John M Forney/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Choi/SF/ECT@ECT,  John Malowney/HOU/ECT@ECT, Holli Krebs/HOU/ECT@ECT, Greg Wolfe/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stewart Rosman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kim Ward/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Debra Davidson/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lester  Rawson/PDX/ECT@ECT, John Zufferli/CAL/ECT@ECT, James D  Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christopher F  Calger/PDX/ECT@ECT, Dave Parquet, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vladimir  Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Monica Lande/PDX/ECT@ECT, Elliot Mainzer/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim  Heizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT, Cooper Richey, Stephen Swain/PDX/ECT@ECT, Susan J  Mara/SFO/EES@EES, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Debra Davidson/PDX/ECT@ECT  Subject: Price Caps  The following summarizes recent price cap events in California.  I think that  I have most of it right.  If there is anything wrong or missing please let me  know.  Please dont share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of  Enron.  Regards, Tim  New Cap Specifics On 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a  new price cap methodology. The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as  can be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to  achieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date  might be. The new price cap methodology will remain in place until: Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven  to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions. Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal. Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the  following heat rate table:   Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap   <25 GW   10,775   $43.10   25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70   30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90   35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90   >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment. Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps. The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior  to the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISOs two day-ahead  system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior  to the hour of delivery.  FERC Context FERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000. The ISO has asserted that they dont need FERC authority since it is a bid  cap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of  electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices. The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.   FERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days  after their authority expires) FERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its  206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We dont know  what they will find or what they will propose. The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will  likely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on  11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral  comments. Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price  caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations. It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into  effect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC  extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from  the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.  Impact of Price Caps The attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at  different gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets  would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to  say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap  because we dont know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the  cap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below. Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.    Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new  price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices. Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets. Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.   For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January  through September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January  through September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400  from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual  observations. We created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the  calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices  for each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each  hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour  could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly  average cap value! The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000  NYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power  prices which are in excess of the proposed cap.

__label__Save	Re: Outage Tracker Option And Background Karl,  Thanks a lot. I have passed this information to Grant Masson who worked here on a related problem. He will get in touch with you regarding this technology.  Vince      Karl Tomlinson@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 07/24/2000 06:00 PM To: Vince J Kaminski@ECT cc:   Subject: Outage Tracker Option And Background   Vince,  To follow up on the idea of a means for effectively tracking instantanious  plant faliure utilising either system frequency or connection point voltage.  The system frequency phase shift across a network will probably be the best  option as this would allow alll significant deviations to be tracked along  with relative network performance from a few points.  I am currently chasing NEMMCO (AU system operator) to get hold of a few weeks  of 4 second metering data for the whole system to see if there is enough  measurement consistency to prove one of the ideas.  The idea follows along the lines (literally !) that when a unit fails it will  introduce a shock into the system and reduce system frequency, which is then  reacted to by frequency control services offered in by generators. The drop  in frequency is noticable across the whole network and as one option may  change the phase shift across the whole grid. The phase shift across the  network is constantly changing due to loads and power factor correctrion  devices switching on and off, however a unit failure may be distinct.  The second option relates to how a unit fails, whereby if a circuit breaker  is involved as in the case of uncontrolled shutdowns, then the outage will  cause an RF pulse that should propogate across some of the network.  Transformers will attenuate the pulse, however it should be detectable many  miles away from the fault location. Measure the arrival time at several point  on the network, work out the shift and backtrack on the network. Part of the  solution is already proven in lightning trackers. The solution may be made  more simple by detecting the exact point on the sinewave that the unit failed  (i.e. measuring the three phases at 1MHz and then sending the data through a  DSP). This solution is more complex, however this should allow unit failure  to be pinpointed to a station. The timing base for each of the nodes may be  sourced from GPS timing, self locating at the same time !  Will send you some links and documents for potentail hardware and setups.   Karl.

__label__DontSave	Risk Assessment and Portfolio Optimisation for Oil and Gas Dear Vince,  Risk Assessment and Porfolio Optimisation for Oil and Gas, 23rd-24th October, Holiday Inn, Victoria, London  I am producing the above conference and have been speaking with both Ron Bain from Anadarko Petroleum and Soussan Faiz from Texaco who recommended that I contact you. I understand that you have a wealth of experience in real options and that this is an area that Enron is extremely committed to. I would love to invite you to come along and speak as I think that you would make a vital addition to the programme. Your colleague Shirley recommended that I email some details over first of all - I hope you dont mind.  I have drawn up a draft programme (attached below) based on my research, but please do bear in mind that this is very much a developing programme and if you have any comments Id really like to hear them. Also if you feel that you would like to present an area that I have not covered in the programme or would like me to rewrite a session I would be more than happy to do so.  I know that you are extremely busy and must get approached regularly to speak at conferences, however I really do believe that this will be a fantastic opportunity to publicise Enron as a leader across Europe. We will be marketing this conference to over 40,000 targeted individuals, including a direct mail of at least 25,000 and in addition an online and press campaign.  We will be looking to work with leading industry press such as Petroleum Review, Oil and Gas Journal, Offshore Magazine and Harts E&P and can also undertake mailings for our speakers and sponsors to their contacts and clients.  Just to let you know of my deadlines, I am working to a very tight deadline and will need confirmation by Thursday 14th June if you are interested in getting more involved in this programme.  I appreciate that this is very short notice, but at this stage I would need very little from you.  You would simply need to choose an appropriate session or I can adapt a short abstract for you and I can co-ordinate with your assistant to get a biography for the brochure.  I look forward to hearing from you soon and sincerely hope that you can make it.

__label__Save	Petrochem Desk I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that theyd only been around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.     From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

__label__Save	El Paso Statement on California Situation In case you havent already seen this:  El Paso Addresses the California Energy Situation  ( February 26, 2001 )  HOUSTON, Feb. 26 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG) reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties involved to help improve Californias energy situation. We are surprised to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning El Pasos involvement in California, said Norma Dunn, senior vice president of Corporate Communications and External Affairs at El Paso Corporation. We would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record.  The significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power, which has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate electricity. High natural gas prices are, therefore, an effect rather than a cause of the power shortage.  Allegations that natural gas prices were deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue. It is not possible for any holder of capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline to cause a significant increase in California gas prices by refusing to use that capacity. The El Paso Natural Gas pipeline is required by law to post the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate found to be just and reasonable by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. All capacity held by El Paso Merchant Energy on the El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to serve California and other Western markets.  Allegations that there was a conspiracy in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into California are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge. The facts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990s were either built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer support to justify their construction. For example, despite years of marketing efforts by Tenneco, not a single potential customer could be induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed Altamont project to proceed. For that reason alone, it was ultimately dropped. In 1996, according to estimates, there were between one and two billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of excess natural gas transportation capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving California. Indeed, it was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess capacity that prompted the California Public Utilities Commission to encourage PG&E, SoCal Edison, and SoCal Gas, beginning in 1996 and continuing into 1998, to relinquish over 1.5 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline. Processes are now under way to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity into California, and El Paso intends to do its part to help satisfy whatever needs may be established today.  As recently as last year, there were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands at that time. Notwithstanding its availability, this capacity was not used by shippers to California to fill in- state natural gas storage facilities for future use. If California had taken advantage of the opportunity in 2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999, reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in prices at the California border could have been substantially mitigated or avoided.  It is now widely recognized that the California energy crisis was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in California to keep pace with the states economy and increased demand. A combination of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices. First, the construction of new power plants in California is a slow, difficult, and heavily regulated process. As a result, the growing demand has far outstripped in-state generating capabilities. Second, unfavorable precipitation and increased out-of-state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power normally relied on by California to become unavailable. Third, increased demand for power in the western United States drove up prices that California had to pay to out-of-state generators. Fourth, state policies deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers, leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their costs. Fifth, because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased costs to consumers, the utilities creditworthiness was impaired, causing supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and expensive to purchase. Sixth, the early and greater-than-normal use of peaking units-plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand conditions-necessitated unscheduled maintenance, rendering them unavailable at critical times. Seventh, during the final months of 2000, some power plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air emissions credits. Eighth, a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold weather further drove up demand for power. Finally, the increased power costs in California could have been substantially mitigated through long-term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short-term power market.  California is currently in a difficult position, but now has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long-term energy policy, said Dunn. El Paso has been one of the largest suppliers of energy to California for more than 50 years, and we are actively participating with all parties in California to be a part of a long-term, stable solution to Californias energy needs.  El Paso Corporation, the largest and most broadly based natural gas company in the world, spans the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. With an enterprise value in excess of $50 billion, El Paso is a leader in every phase of the natural gas industry. The company owns and operates a significant portion of the North American natural gas delivery grid, operates the fastest growing, most sophisticated energy merchant group, and is the nations third largest natural gas producer.

__label__Save	Contstraints on the shape of a smile Stinson ,Vince ,Zimin,  Heres a brief document on constraints on the shape of a smile for a fixed  expiry date. the constraints are neccessary and sufficient for no arbitrage in this case. Ive used a template created by Dr. Leppard which is why it looks so scary.   If you need constraints in the time direction then I will have to think a  little bit more about it. I think constraints in this direction are very model depenendent e.g.  stochastic volatility and local volatility models will throw up different constraints.      Steve, I am not sure if our traders (or quants for that matter) are aware of these  constraints and some desks are beginning to build smiles...

__label__Save	UK Inflation and Storage model Hi Zimin,  INFLATION: I am also spending a lot of time looking at short-term auto-regressive models  for PPI and long-term, more fundamentally-based models.  This work is  important because we have potentially a large positive P&L that may be  unlocked by moving to our new indicative UK PPI curves.  John Sherriff and  Trena are keen that any models I produce are vetted/approved in Houston, so I  will forward to Stinson or yourself initially for review once ready and  documented.  STORAGE: Thanks for the current storage  model.  Due to the complexity of the  modelling issues involved, I would strongly support a visit by you to help me  meet the needs of the London customers in this matter, and am happy to act as  the anchor for information flow in the mean time.

After getting that book I will redo the US inflation model.   Our exposure to CPI inflation risk is huge (think about how many contracts signed by EES),  so the US model is very important.

The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.    Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.  Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.  Enron in the Middle East  Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar. Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.  Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub.   Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack=  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the=  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a=  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic= ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc= us is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis.  Many legislative Republic= ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o= nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would double=  dip into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg= islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th= e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac= e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon= g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t= hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in = breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th= e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi= ll be very difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat= e would eat the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately = $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this = concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful= l disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis, including the = details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=  will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB = 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi= ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac= k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo= r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am= ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre= ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowens language states that the state should get = paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li= kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).  According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic= ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in = the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 = of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ= icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=  to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo= rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind= ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.  Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount:$4.125 B Lenders:JP Morgan$2.5 B Lehman Brothers$1.0 B Bear Stearns$625 M Tax Exempt Portion:Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate:Taxable Rate5.77% Tax-Exempt Rate4.77% Current Projected Blended IR:5.38% Maturity Date:August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t= he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut= horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi= tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power = going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz= ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor = has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is = that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f= urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it = is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas= ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif= ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi= dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl= ier in the crisis.  SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T= he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the = governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au= gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t= o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s= igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi= s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat= es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank= ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.   The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is= suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s= tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th= en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st= ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p= assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

__label__DontSave	MSCF Advisory Board Membership Vince,  I am pleased to hear you will be returning to MSCF this year, participating in the Speaker Series on December 7.   Enron has a tremendous reputation in quantitative finance circles and your obvious interest in our students is deeply appreciated.  I know, too, our students are very much looking forward to your visit.  On a separate but definitely related matter, would you consider serving on our Advisory Board?   You will note our present membership (http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/advisory.html) reflects no representation from an energy firm.  I speak on behalf of the MSCF Steering Committee in expressing our hope that you would be willing to correct this!  The Advisory Board meets once a year, usually in the late fall in New York. Its six (or so) members serve for a three year term.  Enrons participation on the MSCF Board would allow you to influence the direction of the program to the advantage of the energy companies and give you access to a first look at the MSCF Resume Book.  From our standpoint, your experience and counsel would be of tremendous benefit to us as we consider challenges and opportunities in the MSCF program in the years ahead.  Our 2001 meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, Dec. 12 in mid-town Manhattan. Would you be willing join us?  Rick  Mr. Richard L.

__label__Save	Re: Henwood query Good talking with you this morning.  By all means, talk to Grant Masson about who else is using the Henwood model within Enron.  Attached are the workbooks I mentioned.  The Details of Jan and July.xls workbook contains the resulting listing from the query I gave you yesterday and you can see how the supply curve was created from that.  The supply curve becomes nonsense at points for reasons I believe are related to reliability commitment constrants, instead of pure economic dispatch, and to the aggregate reporting problem I described in my note yesterday.  The workbook Supply Curve.xls has the simplistic, average supply curve I mentioned, constructed from fuel and VOM costs.  Depending on the question you are trying to answer, it may be an approach to consider.  The Henwood Contacts I had in mind are:  Tao Guo, PhD, Senior Algorithmist  (916-569-0985) * the one I was thinking of Wenxiong Huang, PhD Senior Project Consultant (916-569-0985) Ajit Kulkarni, PhD, Software Product Manager (916-569-0985) * more a trainer, but sharp Cosimo Coscia, Senior Consultant (South Australia) 618-8357-1244 * very resourceful Wade Schauer, Staff Consultant, (916-569-0985) * best for questions about EMSS per se  all have emails, of course.  Template:  tguo@hesinet.com  Also, if you can not get satisfaction, contact Eric Toolson, VP (916-569-0985).  He has a laconic style, but is very focused on customer satisfaction and retention.  And he has the pull to make things happen.  Regards, Michael       >>> Karolina Potter/LON/ECT@ENRON 08/24/00 07:08AM >>>  Michael,   I am an analyst in Paul Meads Continental Power Trading group in London. I am currently working on the project, which requires the use of EMSS, and experience some difficulties interpreting the output results. Steven Leppard from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and consequently the person to contact in case of problems.   I have been running simulations for the Dutch market and was asked to provide the traders with some front-end screen graphs in order to interpret the numerical results. One of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and systems marginal cost, as we only run cost based scenarios. To sort each stations hourly generation I need its marginal cost. To my knowledge though, marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit (TransArea Marginal Units query, Marg_cost unit). Therefore I was sorting the stations according to the cost which I calculated based on the outputs from Station Detail by Hour query. The calculation was as follows:   For each hour, for each generating station:   marginal cost [o/MWh] = (Generation_Cost [o000] * 1000)/Generation [MWh] - VOM_cost [o/MWh]   This I thought would include fuel cost and start up costs. However, a marginal station which I get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a station given in Marginal Station field in TransArea Marginal Units query. I have also looked into TransArea_Data_Hr table and TransArea_Data table but non of the costs there match my results.   Do you happen to know what formula is used to determine Marg_cost and which outputs I should be using to obtain the right results?   It might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone. In this case could you please send me your direct telephone number. I am struggling understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much.

To achieve   this goal, the BFS organizes every two years an International Congress.      The scientific program of the 2002 BFS Congress consists of plenary   talks and contributed papers. The invited plenary talks will give an   overview of the latest important developments in the field. They will   also present new ideas, directions and methodologies from Finance,   Economics, Econometrics and Mathematics and, discuss pressing problems   in the Finance and Insurance industries.
