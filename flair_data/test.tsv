__label__Save	calculating bid-ask prices This is about Enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for trading future of a movies gross box office receipt. Rich sent to many people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide some feedback.  I think the idea (see below) might be applicable to other parts of Enron. We can call it Dynamic bid-ask price process. In fact, we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is submitted to the system within a specified amount of time. The final (clearing) bid and ask prices are just the last tentative price shown to the public before the bidding period ends. (So the customers can see the final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish.)  I think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via EnronOnline.com. -Chonawee   ---------------------- Forwarded by Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron on 04/24/2001 07:48 PM ---------------------------   Chonawee Supatgiat 04/24/2001 07:40 PM To: Richard DiMichele/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Harkness/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Greg Wolfe/HOU/ECT@ECT, James Ginty/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Jim Fallon/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kelly Kimberly/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kevin Howard/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Key Kasravi/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kristin Albrecht/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kristina Mordaunt/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Martin Lin/Contractor/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Paul Racicot/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Zachary McCarroll/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Martin Lin/Contractor/Enron Communications@Enron Communications   Subject: calculating bid-ask prices   I think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to forecast it. Otherwise, if our forecast is not consistence with the market, we may have an imbalance in the bid-ask orders and we may end up taking some positions. You know, as Russ and Martin pointed out, we cannot fight with the studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the price easily.  One way to ensure the balance of the bid-ask orders is to embed an exchange system inside our bid-ask prices front end. Each week, we have a trading period. During the period, instead of posting bid-ask prices, we post tentative bid-ask prices, then we ask our customers to submit their acceptable buying or selling price. These tentative bid-ask prices get updated and are shown to the public. Of course, customers can revise/withdraw their bids anytime during the trading period. At the end of the period, we calculate and post the final bid and ask prices. The seller who submits lower selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price. The buyer who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask price. Next week, we repeat the same process.  This way, we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a broker where we dont take any position at all. We make profit from those bid-ask spread. We dont have to worry about forecasting accuracy and insiders trading because we dont have to take any position. Let the market be the one who decides the price.   If we maintain our net position as zero, at the end, when all the actual gross box office numbers are reported in those publications, our customers with open long/short positions are perfectly matched. Using the mark-to-market charge can reduce credit risk.

I think that we, as a market maker, can reduce our credit risk (risk of default) if we do the mark-to-market charging. That is, each week when we release a new expected value of the gross box office receipt, we balance all the opening positions the same way as in a regular future market. This way, we can give margin calls to the couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money. In the last paragraph, I think the gross box office can also be determined from the market itself (i.e., if there are lots of buyers, our offer price should go up.) We can offer other derivative products such as options as well. -Chonawee Chonawee Supatgiat <Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron@ENRON> chonawee.supatgiat@enron.com enron.com Stinson Gibner <Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT> stinson.gibner@enron.com  Vince J Kaminski <Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT> vince.kaminski@enron.com 
__label__Save	Re: looking for Fat Tails in time-series for NGI-SOCAL Vince,                 I quite agree, we have to separate out price and position,  and that is what we have done with the historical simulations/EVT ideas.  We  have taken todays delta-gamma, hold that frozen, and gone back historically  and looked at price changes and see what happens to portfolio changes.     Garman and company have looked at gross historical portfolio changes, which I  agree is not the best approach, due to the artificiality imposed by largest  Net Open Positions (NOP), such as we have seen recently.

Changes in the portfolio values may combine both the changes  of prices and positions. This happens if one tracks changes in the value of our historical gas  portfolio. A big jump in the volumetric position from day to day, combined with a moderate price  movement may produce an observation that looks artificially big.  If the volumetric position was frozen, its just a scaling factor and there  should be  no discrepancy between your numbers. Of course, the correct approach is to separate the price process from the position changes.

Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large  returns more frequent than normal),  which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).

__label__Save	California Update 3/15/01 Executive Summary ? Davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for  past utility debt ? Davis and PG&E negotiations at a standstill, sticking point is net short  for PG&E this summer  ? As the days go on with no word of a secured deal, involuntary bankruptcy  chances increase significantly among small generators and QFs ? FERC would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions  for California  California Public Utility Commission Rate Increases  Today may be the turning point as the CA PUC reviews the size of the  Department of Water Resources  (DWR) rate increase to be passed along to  consumers on their electricity bills.  Until now, Davis has considered rate  hikes to be political suicide, but there may be some relief for him from  consumer groups.   Sources indicate that one of Californias main consumer  advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption,  but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt.  DWR,  which is currently buying power on behalf of the state, needs more income to  securitize the planned $10B bond issue that is key part of Davis plan to  sign long term power contracts.  As DWR continues to spend $40 to $60 M every  day on power purchases, a well placed source informed us the DWR is  essentially bankrupt.  It currently has no money for normal activities such  as ordering supplies, purchasing new equipment, etc.  The Department of  Finance is forwarding DWR money from where ever it can (parks, other  programs) to purchase power, but DWRs hands are tied until revenue bonds are  issued.  The California State Treasurer Phil Angelides will be submitting a  recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $10  billion worth of state bonds.   Davis & PG&E at Odds  Sources report that Davis and PG&E negotiations are facing two difficult  challenges: 1) PG&E wants 2.9 times book, which is far more than consumer  groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines (SCE accepted 2.3),  and 2) PG&E needs relief from Davis for PG&Es legal responsibility to be the  ultimate power purchaser for the state, and at this point Davis wants to  limit further state energy power purchases (especially for summer).  The  utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars  further in the red ($3 to $4 B) and PG&E may declare bankruptcy for their  utility subsidiary if Davis tries to force the issue.  Additionally, Davis is  being hounded by the press and Harvey Rosenfield to publish details of the  states 40 long-term power contracts; a measure that if accomplished would  provide Davis with even less negotiating power.  With all this activity, Davis is starting to lose support in the state  legislature.  Sources report increasing tension between the Governor and  State Senate President Pro-tem John Burton.  Burton has just announced a  special Senate Committee will investigate the generators for evidence of  price manipulation, and the State Auditor is also planning an investigation.   Davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being  picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later.  QFs Most Likely Source of Involuntary Bankruptcy Sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience  and force bankruptcy on the utilities.  SB 47X may have been Californias  Qualified Facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing  against PG&E, SoCal Ed, and SDG&E.  The bill designed to cut the QFs costs  and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the States  senate.  Sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further  investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates.  Out with Hebert, In with Wood The Bush administration favors replacing Hebert, Jr. with Texas PUC head Pat  Wood.  There is an intense battle behind the scenes between Senate Republican  Leader Trent Lott , who favors Hebert, and President Bush, who wants Wood.   The administration would prefer Wood because they do not want FERC to pick a  fight with Davis which means Bush might ultimately lose some western states  in 2004.  In effort to tone down the recent press reports, Hebert has made  several token concessions to California, including $69 million worth of power  refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and  power plant installation.    Its is expected that FERC would most likely approve any transmission deal  that Davis could complete but with a list of conditions.  Some conditions  might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well  as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic Administrative actions in  the West next year.  The Bush Administration is opposed to price caps and  believes in free market solutions.  The Administration is also considering  whether it might be a good idea to privatize Federally-owned assets such as  BPA.

Get Better Now!                                                   oguhh JOINT HEAL  If you have deteriorating joints of any kind, joint heal will help regenerate that loss.  Joint Heal has chicken collagen in it as well as the famed glucosamine sulfate.  It also has MSM in it along with Chondroitin Sulfate.  One study quoted by chemist Robert Barefoot told of 387 chronic arthritic patients, half in wheelchairs, who were treated with crushed chicken collagen and gelatin.  ALL were improved and all were out of their wheelchairs in six weeks.  These types of stories do not get publicized as do medications which can not work.  As the medications keep the individual in a gradual decline, people need to realize how simple the answer really is.   Joint pain decreases within three days or sooner as regeneration begins. Joint Heal is 37.95 per bottle, 120 tablets. plus $5.95 shipping and handling.  Call 800-395-7379 to order by credit card.  Joint Heal is nothing like the normal joint products found in the Health food stores. Joint Heal was created by an individual whose mother had knotted up hands from arthritis.  He worked years on a formula that finally helped straightened her hands and has been selling it throughout the world for 4 years.  That product is Joint Heal.  Glucosamine sulfate alone can do only a fraction of what the combination found in Joint Heal can do.  Below is the unmatched combination of ingredients found in Joint Heal.  Vitamin C  100mg, MSM (Methyl-Sulfonyl-Methane)  750mg, Chicken Colagen 250gm, Chondroitin Sulfate (from chicken sternal cartilage) Magnesium  200mg, Copper  500mcg, Manganese  5m, Sodium (as glucosamine sulfate)  60mg, Glucosamine Sulfate 750mg,  Boron  750  mcg.

We were introduced to this group inside Toshiba through the Carlyle Groups Japan office.  Dr. Uenohara, from Toshiba, is travelling to New York City to speak at the 11th INFORMS Applied Probability Society Conference.  The URL is: http://www.cap.columbia.edu/informs-aps/ap-2001.html  Dr. Uenohara is interested in applying this model to power markets and would very much like to speak with someone from Enron during his trip to the US.  Is anyone from Enron going to be attending the conference?  If there is someone going, it would be worthwhile to facilitate a meeting.  If not, Dr. Uehara has stated he would travel to Houston between the dates of July 31 and August 4 to explain his model and the possibility of working with Enron.  Toshiba is currently working with Daiwa here in Japan, however they told us in the meeting that Daiwa was way too slow and they were looking for other companies to work with in the application of the model to different types of markets.  Please give me the name of a suitable contact in the event that we are able to arrange a visit for Dr. Uenohara to Houston.  Toshiba will be sending me the presentations we received today and I will forward them to you as soon as I receive them.   Regards, Mark Brady  Mark Brady Enron Japan Corp.

__label__DontSave	Re: UK VaR calibration Rudi and Steve, factor loading analysis was performed at the end of September for 17  following UK curves:  PPPWD1-PPPWD6, PPPWE1-PPPWE6,  PE, PEO, NBP, SYSTEMDAY and SYSTEMNIGHT.  This analysis was based on historical forward prices information from  RisktRac. I sent the results to Vlady and Naveen for review on 10/4/00.  The results look decent for 3 curves only: NBP, SYSTEMDAY and SYSTEMNIGHT. Decent looks as follows:   Decent means: the factors are rather smooth, the first one makes the  largest contribution, the second one changes sign once.  The factors for the rest curves do not look good, for example for PE:    This messy picture means that the prices for different maturity contracts for  PE are not highly correlated and factor loadings analysis is meaningless in this case.  My conclusions:  1.We should use NBP, SYSTEMDAY, SYSTEMNIGHT factors and map all other UK  curves into one of those. 2. Winstons code is ready. 3. The mappings have to be identified by Risk Control and communicated to  Winston.  Thank you,  Tanya..

__label__DontSave	RE: PLEASE READ -Analysis of variance between spreadsheet VaR and RisktRAC VaR for UK Power Slava,     We were involved in the reconciliation efforts Wed/Thur, and am glad that the confusion has now abated.  A broader issue is the concept that even the (lower) spreasheet VaR does not backtest well.  Couple of reasons for that: (1) The P/L valuation, viz-a-viz the spreadoption, might not be using the same inputs as the VaR calculation (vols and correlations between primary curves). (2) Having said point (1), I would still be more comfortable having the current RiskTrac number (25MM), as a provision for the spurious nature of the back-end curve movements (the backend does not move, so your P/L would be small, however, we still have tremendous back-end risk (if you look at the PL swings, you would see discrete large jumps in P/L, suggesting this phenomenon).   Let us know how the RiskTrac usage progress.

Please see the previous 2 days which will provide the history.  Essentially we have now reached the stage where we can explain the jump in VaR from moving from the VaR spread sheet to RiskTrac based largely on the good work that Fergus Trenholme - London Risk Management and Stig Faltinsen - London Research have done  (it has been a team effort as many others have been called in as appropriate and I would like to thank them too).  A full analysis is contained in the note from Fergus and Stig below but the key points to note are:  the changing of the input parameters partially explains the difference in the VAR number between the 2 systems but not completely (including the change in factor loadings) the vast majority of the difference in the VAR numbers between the 2 systems is caused by the splitting of the volumetric position into the (primary and secondary) component curves in RiskTrac. In RiskTrac PPP is currently set as the primary curve even though 75% of the position is on the station gate curve where as in the spreadsheet the whole position is against the PPP curve  As a result of us now being able to isolate and explain the jump in VaR from moving to RiskTrac we will be reporting this number from now on. That said does the VaR number sound right ? The numer is theoretically but is the theory close to reality in the Uk Power market ?The RiskTrac calculated $25m VaR is a 1 day VaR and the  methodology would imply it should be broken 1 in 20 business days. Based on historical P&Ls this has not been the case and so it does not pass the sense check. (note that the original $13m VaR was only broken once or twice in the last year).  There are many potential explanations why, but if we think about how the price and volatility curves move they typically only move at the short end (ie only the first 2 years) and the component VarR for this period is in the order of $8m. This could therefore imply that the volatilities we are using to calculate the VaR are too high. The book undoubtedly contains significant risk but due to market illiquidity more consideration should be given to jumps or shocks.  The book does posses increased fat tail risk at this lower VaR level which is not  captured in the current VaR calculation.  Outstanding issues / work  Based on the second bullet point above consideration needs to be given to changing the primary and secondary curve settings as well as the correlations and factor loadings for and between all the curves. The impact of any such changes will need to be quantified. Fergus and Stig aim to work with Houston research and the business on this over the next few days / week(s) and will be providing a regular update to those on this mail list.  Additional work needs to done to assess whether the VaR  number  / methodology being calculated / employed by RiskTrac truly represents the expected volatility and performance of the portfolio and truly represents the 1 day earnings risk for 19 out of 20 days. It would also be appropriate, given the nature of the market and the term structure of the portfolio, to assess the fat tail risk being run.  I am away for the next 2 weeks so Fergus and Stig will be sending regular progress updates.    ---------------------- Forwarded by James New/LON/ECT on 17/05/2001 19:10 --------------------------- To: James New/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Tani Nath/LON/ECT@ECT, Viacheslav Danilov/LON/ECT@ECT, Tanya Tamarchenko/Enron@EnronXGate, Kirstee Hewitt/LON/ECT@ECT, Fergus Trenholme/EU/Enron@Enron, Naveen Andrews/Enron@EnronXGate, Mike E Presley/ENRON@enronXgate   Subject: Analysis of variance between spreadsheet VaR and RisktRAC VaR for UK Power  Due to recent variances in UK Power VaR between the VaR spreadsheet (SS) model and RisktRAC (RT), despite small differences in Net Open Positions,  London Research and Risk Management have investigated these discrepancies with the results as below.   COB 14 May 2001data was chosen as a test example      DPR   RT NOP (TWh)   43.460  42.255    VaR (USD MM) 14.118  24.749      Summary of analysis: (for UK Power only)  Following checks of  parameter and position inputs to the London VaR SS, and a VaR recalc (with appropriate  inputs from RT), the resultant VaR change does not seem to explain the discrepancies between RT and the SS VaR number. Consideration of the term structure of the Net Open Positions in both RT and SS showed only minor differences. Adhoc VaR calculation using SS positions run through RT . The VaR obtained was comparable to the SS VaR.  Adhoc VaR run through RT with curve positions correctly mapped to the relevant price curves, rather than aggregated to PPP curve.  Analysis of inputs to the London Spreadsheet (SS) VaR model  PLEASE NOTE THAT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE ALL CHANGES WERE PERFORMED ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS (i.e one change made and then returned to original state before changing another variable)  Correlations Impact of RT correlations in SS : NEW VAR = USD 15.220 MM (Energy Trend (ET) correlations mapped to PPPWD3, as RT does not contain ET correlation data. By keeping ET correlations the matrix became non positive definite, and hence unusable for VaR model). If the correlation matrix is larger (i.e. takes into account more markets) in RT as opposed to the SS this could also have a (marginal) effect (mainly because the Cholesky factorisation will be different).    Factor loadings  FIVE VERSUS SEVEN FACTOR LOADINGS (SS uses 5 rather than 7 as per RT)  Houston Research (Jaesoo Lew) analysis has shown the effect of using five versus seven factor loadings. Considering one of the primary curves as an example  (PWD3). Five factor loadings describe 96.89 % of the movement of the curve whereas seven factors describe 98.53 %. Therefore the choice of whether to use 5 or 7 factors should not have a substantial impact on the VaR.      Impact of RT factor loadings in SS : NEW VaR = USD 9.44 MM(ET (Energy Trends curve) with original factor loadings)          New VaR = USD  9.55 MM (ET factor loadings mapped to (PPP WD3))  Volatilities  Impact of RT volatilities in SS : no change in VaR (vols are the same)  Prices  Impact of RT prices in SS : no change in VaR (prices are the same with the impact of rounding errors providing very small immaterial differences)  Positions Impact of RT positions in SS : no change in VaR  Forward forward volatilities  Impact of utilising seasonality flag (set to ON) in SS : NEW VaR = USD 14.650 MM In RT these are assumed to be ON constantly, as are the fwd fwd volatilities (due to using implied rather than historic vol inputs) Impact of utilising fwd fwd vol flag (set to OFF) in SS : NEW VaR = USD 18.85 MM The fwf fwd vol flag should be set to on in the SS model  Combining different parameters The impact of RT correlations and RT factor loadings and several other combinations all gave changes to the VaR. However, the net result did not substantially differ from the results above (in blue).   Other issues: Intramonth  positions -  not included in RT or  SS (for UKPower).   Primary and secondary curve mappings. see below for Adhoc VaR results  Currency conversion : Prices are in GBP. Does any term structure apply to GBP/USD FX (forward) curve used for transformation to USD VaR dollar Forward curve?  Therefore changing the input parameters partially explains the difference in the VaR between the two systems, but NOT completely.   Checking differences in the term structure of positions  UK Power Portfolio is fed from three different sources; ET Elec positions are fed via a spreadsheet to the RT book UKPowerswap1, The Eastern books are also fed via spreadsheet into RT books called E1SB1, E1SB3, E2XX1,E2XX3. The UK Power book positions are uploaded directly from EnPower to the UK Power Portfolio in RT. Differences: ET ELEC : none EnPower : total difference of (62.737) TWh (of which (63.700) is from June 01) Eastern : total difference of (2,913,408) TWh (for the  E1SB3 book only). Misfeed causing this error now corrected.  Ad-Hoc VaR Calculation Results  Run 1 :  Positions from the SS where ET Elec was mapped to WD3. VaR = USD 17.813 MM Run 2 :  Positions from the SS where 1/12 of ET Elec positions were mapped to the 12 primary curves (PPP Wd and WE curves)  VaR = USD 16.810 MM  The VaR results obtained from Runs 1 and 2 are comparable with the VaR number from the SS. The differences between these runs and the SS number can be attributed to parameter input variances (as described above)  Run 3 : Positions from SS split into component curves (i.e SG, N+P, NBP and PPP) rather than aggregated into PPP curves. ET Elec still split equally over the PPP positions. VaR USD = 25.432 MM.  This is almost exactly in line with the headline UKPower VaR calculated through RT.  UK Power exposure composition (TWh by curve price source) PPP  (2.9) NBP  9.5 N+P  (11.6) SG  (32.6)   _____ Total  (37.6)  Within the SS, all positions from above (i.e (37.6) TWh) were mapped to the PPP curves, whereas in RT all curves were mapped individually as secondary curves (where PPP acts as primary curve) - even though PPP curve has smallest amount of price risk attached to it through having the smallest Net Open Position. The adhoc results support the assumption that  most of the RT VaR within the PPP_NEW book is due to SG and N+B rather than PPP.  The business may now want to consider the primary / secondary relationships used within RT for UKPower based upon the net exposures against each curve. Research suggests that SG should now become a primary curve based upon these results if price data is available for factor loading and correlation data analysis.. Further analysis on the impact of this change would be needed to quantify the effect of this.  As VaR (at the 95% confidence interval) should typically represent expected losses over 1 day for 1 day in a 20 day period, backtesting should demonstrate this by illustrating a realised PnL loss greater than the VaR number. However, for UK Power, the realised PnL losses have only exceeded the VaR approximately once over the last 300 days. By increasing the reported VaR number, this may not seem appropriate given the underlying reasoning behind VaR and empirical evidence from backtesting. It should be borne in mind that the current structure of the UK Power markets, since the introduction of NETA, has only been in operation for approximately 45 days. For this reason, all data considered for either correlation or factor loading analysis should be considered with care.   The introduction of NETA into the UK Power market has necesserily created more risk to Enron, especially until the market settles down and gains maturity and stability. Therefore, the revised UK Power VaR of USD 25 MM is not entirely inappropriate, although still appears a high number in absolute terms. Research and Risk Management will investigate the underlying parameter levels during the next few days now that the core assumptions have been verified.           <Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)> <Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)> <Embedded Picture (Metafile)> Andrews, Naveen andrews@enron.com enron.com Danilov viacheslav.danilov@enron.com Murphy ted.murphy@enron.com  Ted </o=ENRON/ou=NA/cn=Recipients/cn=EU/cn=Recipients/cn=tmurph1> j.kaminski@enron.com  Kaminski tanya.tamarchenko@enron.com  Vince J </o=ENRON/ou=NA/cn=Recipients/cn=Vkamins> david.port@enron.com
__label__Save	Improving option valuation precision in ERMS Allan,  Paulo Issler in our group, working with Eric Moon in structuring, recently  tracked down the reason for a slight mis-match in option pricing in ERMS vs.  the structuring spreadsheets.  It is due to the fact that the option  valuation functions in ERMS use a slightly less accurate approximation for  the cumulative normal distribution.  We would be happy to work with the right  person to update the ERMS code in order to close this discrepancy.   Please  let me know how you would like to proceed.  If you are not the correct person to address the mainenance of ERMS, please  let me know who to contact.

Vince Kaminski 1400 Smith Street 30th Floor, Rm. 3036B Houston, TX 77002-7361 1 713-853-3848  Dear Vince Kaminski,  This is to inform you of the release of @ENERGY v2.2. FTP download instructions are available immediately. The download instructions are included at the end of this email. Please see below for more information regarding this new release.  Please confirm that your address above is correct by clicking reply and send. If any changes need to be made, please make the changes above and reply.  Here is an overview of the new features from the release notes:  @ENERGY (Forward Curve) No change.  @ENERGY (Basics) No change.  @ENERGY (Advanced) No change.  @ENERGY (Swing) No change.  @ENERGY (Weather) No change.  @ENERGY (Storage) Module  @ENERGY (Storage) is the new module for analyzing storage contracts.  The two new functions specifically designed for valuation and management of storage contracts are: 7 STORAGEOPT and  MCSTORAGEOPT  To get familiar with these new functions, we recommend that you first read the brief description of the type of storage contracts supported in the Instruments section. A description of the methodology used for valuation is provided in Storage Methodology.  The template storage.xls will help you understand in details input requirements, as well as the output generated by these functions.  See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug fixes.  Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 2.0.  @ENERGY (Forward Curve) No change.  @ENERGY (Basics) A control variate methodology Hull (1997) has been implemented for valuation of American options (OPT), Black and Mean-reverting models. It greatly improves accuracy at minimal cost in speed. All models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options now support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all models.  @ENERGY (Advanced) A faster and more accurate methodology is used to value spread options. Models affected are SPREADOPT, STRIPSPREADOPT, OPTSPREADOPT, OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT. The new methodology dramatically improves speed. All models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options now support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all models.  @ENERGY (Swing) The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all models.  @ENERGY (Weather) No change.

__label__Save	gas prices Vince-  1. We can detect hoarding of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against  the actual inflow.  2. We can detect market power by dissociating the seller from the buyer,  distinguishing between the physical cost in gas to run the generators and  the transmission cost in dollars, i.e. the basis.  3. (As you noted) We can detect storage as the difference between inflow  and consumption.  It appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model  of gas prices: flow rates at interconnects (from telemetry) and spot-market  prices. There is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing  capacity, as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts. The dynamics of gas  prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for  the weather, as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors:  hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas.  We can calibrate the  price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage, and the price  elasticities of demand for transmission, as well as the extent of hoarding,  from the two sets of numbers mentioned: flows and prices.  What the basis  trader needs to understand are the incentives, and disincentives, for storage  and capacity-hoarding, in terms of the calibrated price-elasticities, and  each of these are as-if exotic call options at the consumption hub.  Finally,  flows are explained by the model, and can be imputed from prices if  necessary, resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of  the weather.  I believe the problem is quite tractable, and I would like to proceed with a  model.  Clayton Clayton Vernon clayton.vernon@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com

I apologize if you in fact receive two messages.   Hi Vince,  During our chat at the Texas Finance Festival you spoke of the need to hire technically competent yet creative individuals. I know of someone you might be interested in.  We run an M.Sc. program in Finance at UBC. One of our graduates came into our program with a Ph.D in physics and went on to be one of our top graduates. He spent his summer at the Bank of Canada and they hired him upon graduation. He is currently in their Calgary office. I happened to be corresponding with him recently and he mentioned that he would like to leave the Bank but stay in Calgary. I thought of Enron as a possibility and wondered if you thought there would be some interest. I think he would make an outstanding contribution to any firm he worked for.  I hope you dont mind this imposition but I didnt want potential gains from trade to pass by. If you are interested, please let me know.  Hope all is well with you.

Christian Werner does some really neat things on the weather front. I would like to determine if he can help us to upgrade our systems. Can we bring him to Houston for a week to discuss the weather forecasting  technology with  Mike  Roberts and Joe Hrgovcic?

__label__Save	Non-firm power curve building Hi Vince,   Amitava and I have received a request to build a non-firm power curve for  each region from David Hoogs Double Trigger folks.  The objective, as they  explain it, is to allow the Desk to buy non-firm from the market, buy Davids  outage product, and sell firm to the market.  Accountants would like a curve  to mark the non-firm position.  My initial thought is that the desk should provide this non-firm curve, but  it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they  have put the ball in David Hoogs court to build the curve if David wants to  sell his product internally to the desk.    Assuming we build the curve, the next issue is how to define non-firm?   The only way I can think of is to tie the non-firmness to a specific  generation unit or group of units.  This will allow the purchase of Davids  outage product to cover the non-firmness risk.  Tying the definition of  non-firmness to a whole region seems implausible --- what does it mean to  give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem  anywhere in the region?  Consequently, the non-firm curve takes on a  unit-level interpretation, and not a region-level interpretation.   Consequently, I do not see how we can talk about the non-firm curve for the  region?  We will need to build a non-firm curve for each generation unit or  group of units.  Maybe I could get your thoughts later today.

__label__DontSave	two potential projects at MIT Hi Vince,  How are you?  Everything is going well here in Boston.  I am staying very busy in school with the core business classes.  I am taking an intro to Finance with Myers which is very good, but otherwise my classes are very fundamental.  Im finding the most challenging part of business school is juggling all the extracurricular activities.   Today we kicked off our first official team project which is very similar to the Tiger projects at Wharton that we worked on last spring.  We have a lot of flexibility with the topic of the project.  We are just supposed to find a real company or business unit that will let us analyze a recent, ongoing, or anticipated change initiative.  All that is required is that the initiative be important to the company, represent a change, and have organizational implications.  I dont know if you or a business unit of Enron you know of would like some free consulting in this area, but if so I would love a chance to talk with you about it.     Another group of us are starting an Energy and Environmental Finance Club this year.  Weve collected over $3,000 for the club from about 100 MBA and Manufacturing students, and we will get more from the school.  We would like to bring in speakers from the industry to tell us about new initiatives and the state of the business.  Would you or someone you know be interested in presenting to the club?  The students would really appreciate your involvement.  Please feel free to forward this email to whomever you think may be interested in these projects.  I will try calling later this week to touch base and see how everything is in Houston.  See hello to Shirley and everyone else for me.  ken KenP103@aol.com@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-KenP103+40aol+2Ecom+40ENRON@ENRON.com> kenp103@aol.com aol.com vkamins@enron.com vkamins@enron.com

It has been challenging to find out, from the outside, exactly what your group does on a daily basis and what type of people make up your team. I do not feel that there is any substitute for the information, and feel, that one can get directly from the source itself, thank you for making your team available to meet with me as well.  You mentioned that the Associate Program at Enron could be a great starting point for me to acquire the business skills and experience that I seek. I would be a most enthusiastic candidate as I have looked into the program, and I too, feel that it would be an exciting and logical starting point for me.  It is my understanding that in order for me to enter the program I would require sponsorship. Would you be able to sponsor me for this program? If so, I have attached my cv (as a Word 97 document) and understand that the person to be contacted with a nomination would be Mr Jeff Davis in Human Resources.

The comment about hedgeing JCC with Brent is right  on if the exercise is to hedge our own LNG positions that we have tieds to  JCC. Note that the high JCC correlation to Prompt Brent is not something that  is obvious to non-Enron LNG-tied-to-JCC buyers. If you are an LNG-tied-to-JCC  buyer, and you wish to hedge your purchases, wouldnt you want to be able to  transact ona a JCC contract? My objective is to have a JCC contract on EOL,  whereby we, Enron, take the JCC/Brent risk (which is why we asked Vince  Kaminskis group to study the relationship and give us a hedge ratio to use).  Im attaching a model used to calculate JCC for Dabhol Power Co.s Adgas and  Oman LNG contracts. Basically what happens is that all the raw oil volumes  imported into Japan and added up and the total price is divide by the total  volume, and there is a Yen/US$ foreighn exchange component as well. That is  JCC. It was designed by the Japanese so that they could tie their LNG imports  to their average price of crude imports whereby the LNG would be cheaper on  an MMBTU basis.  Comments?

__label__Save	California Update 3/06/01 Executive Summary ? If no comprehensive deal is reached by April 9th, chances of bankruptcy  increase due to a one day opt-out clause in all long-term power contracts.  ? PG&E and State locked in tough negotiations, several issues on the table:  PUC-imposed requirement forcing PG&E to ultimately be responsible for  California energy supplies  Price of the grid; state - 2.3 times book value vs. PG&E - 4 times book value ? PG&E will not use any of the $1B secured last week to help their ailing  utility. ? Daviss announcement of long term power contract didnt include some  details:  Of the 8,800 megawatts secured this far, only 6,000 are available this  summer   Some of the long term contracts are really only for three months  None of the contracts prevent California from buying peak demand on the spot  market ? One the same day Davis announced long term contracts, Davis also quietly  announce a 10% rate hike. ? FERC may be the wild card in approving this deal.   PG&E Transmissions deal One thing that is still uncertain is PG&E.  Bankruptcy may still be a likely  alternative if current negotiations to buy PG&Es share of the electric  transmission grid fail to produce a deal by April 9 (when all long-term power  contracts being negotiated have a one-day opt-out clause they can exercise  unilaterally if a comprehensive solution has not been reached by the state  and its major utilities).  According to sources close to senior PG&E  officials, PG&E made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal  on the transmission lines depends on the California governments willingness  to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make  until now.   PG&E will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless Davis agrees to  relieve it of the PUC-imposed requirement to be the electricity buyer of  last resort.  Current state regulations make the utility companies  ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all  times to supply Californias energy needs.  As long as the state steps in and  makes those purchases, as it has for the past three months, the utilities are  shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot  market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings.   But, PG&E officials are worried 1) this summers supply and 2) Daviss  concern over how fast he is draining the states budget surplus.  If things  get into a crunch this summer and Davis makes a new decision that the state  will pay only for the electricity it buys through long-term contracts, then  PG&E will be left holding the bag.   Thus, as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid, PG&E is  demanding a comprehensive solution that includes not being liable for cost  differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed  to pay.  State officials are in no mood to grant that kind of get out of  jail free card, so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough  negotiations that are complicated by three other factors: (1) PG&Es public  behavior and welter of announcements in the past few days that seem to  encourage suppliers to force involuntary bankruptcy; (2) State legislative  demands that the price Davis negotiate for PG&Es part of the electricity  grid be no more than 2.3 times revenues from the grid; and (3) the FERC must  positively approve any grid purchase by the state of California.   The principal concern on the price front is that PG&E wants to sell the  electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their  transmission, while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the  politically acceptable limit.  We see 2.3 times book value as an absolute  upper bound. There is no way PG&E will get more than that, whatever they  think, according to the leader of one main consumer groups.  We are going  to try to force any deals down to about 2.0 in any case. Negotiators for  Davis are also trying to proposition-proof any transmission deal to protect  against a later ballot proposal.  They think there are ways to do that, but  not if the price of PG&Es part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative.   Remember, if Daviss eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative, he will  be running for re-election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed  to overturn his solution.  On the Sacramento front - no one understands PG&Es motives The one question no one in Sacramento can figure out is what kind of game  PG&E is playing.  In a three day period PG&E made a series of announcements  that left everyone scratching their heads.  ? Late Thursday, PG&E officials leaked information to California papers that  they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity  transmission grid to the state, which seemed like obvious good news, but then  made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30%  above what the state was currently offering.  While a deal can still be done,  anything like the $10 billion PG&E wants would be very hard to get through  the California legislature which needs to approve any purchase.  ? Late Friday, PG&E officials announced that they had secured a $1 billion  loan for the parent company (not the electricity utility) and would use the  money to pay off bondholders, other creditors and to return $161 million to  shareholders in a new dividend payout.  Not a cent of that money was  earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of PG&E and that left at  least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the  utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood.  ? Over the weekend, PG&E leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay  off its energy suppliers debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now.  For  generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to  start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy  action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will  make them whole in a couple of months, that kind of trial balloon is  extremely unnerving.  Thus, in a very short time period, PG&Es corporate owners showed they could  access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they  were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the  energy crisis.  Davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at  least a part of the $13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer  and PG&Es fund-raising will harden and deepen those demands.  As one senior  political official told our source just when you think the corporate  leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible, they  come up with something even more outrageous.   PG&Es actions also complicate the broader solution Davis is trying to  construct to solve Californias problems.  State Democrats doubt they will  get Republican support for a deal, which means a vote will fall short of the  two-thirds majority necessary for immediate enactment (resulting in 90 days  for the legislation to go into effect).  Additionally, in the past 48 hours,  many Sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less  in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and  may be crafted into any legislation to authorize Davis to purchase the  electricity grid.  Long-term Contracts - Davis didnt tell the whole truth Yesterday, Davis announced that he had signed long-term power deals for  8,800 megawatts of power, out of a total 12,000 megawatts he wanted to sign  eventually. According to the press release, Davis is now 75% of the way  toward his long-term goal and has already solved the hardest part of  Californias energy crisis. This means consumers would maybe pay more than  necessary five years from now, but these contracts guaranteed that  consumers would pay less for the next three years.  What Davis failed to  highlight was that of the 8,800 megawatt commitment, actually only 6,000  megawatts are available this summer (when demand is expected to 45,000  megawatts); and some of these long-term contracts are actually only good  for three months.  None of these contracts, however, keep California from  having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market.  Davis Agrees on New Consumer Electricity Rate Hikes for Next Year While the media was concern with Daviss announcement of long term contracts  for California, of less concern to the media was Daviss quietly announced a  decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers. The state will  accept the 10% emergency surcharge levied on consumers in January as a  permanent increase as well as an additional 10% increase for consumers that  will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires.  That would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour.   FERC The other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve  it in a positive vote. Senior California officials and legislators doubt that  FERC has jurisdiction, and believe that FERC would not dare stop a deal. But  they may be wrong. The deal can only go through if FERC specifically signs  off on the deal. Its power over transmission deal is absolute, no matter what  anyone says, according to source close to the President. There are three  possibilities: 1) FERC could pocket veto it by not even putting it on  agenda for discussion; 2) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted  down. The Democrat on the commission, William Massey, has already said he is  opposed to it; or 3) the Commission could approve it but with condition that  Davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system.  One complicating factor in the FERC decision, however, is that its chairman  Curt Hebert, who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale, may not  be around long enough to have his say. Hebert is definitely not a shoo in  for the FERC chairman position, says one Washington official. Two other  appointments to the Commission will soon be named, this official notes, and  one of them could easily become chairman.

Dear Vince Kaminski  Thank you so much for the kind invitation for the meeting.  I have been always inspired by and having respect for the recent revolutionary achievements of Enron in the energy markets My former employer McKinsey Tokyo in fact featured your company*s success in the last Quarterly, and it clearly states (in Japanese though) that the quantitative research capability at Enron is now at the world*s top level, which has been always behind the scene.  I am extremely honored to receive the email from you and in fact interested in knowing the opportunity of working in the energy field; However, very unfortunately I will have to come back to Japan, or at least to the East Asian region,  upon graduation due to an inevitable family reason. My wife*s father passed away recently and an old mother-in-law is now left alone without relatives. I understand that Enron has not yet embarked on the next big project of freeing the outdated Japanese energy market, (which by the way I strongly hope ) so I may not have a very good chance of making contribution at your company right now.  Lastly, if you need a staff in Tokyo in some future who understands  both the risk management analytics at the F622 level and the local language and business custome better than average, please contact me any time.  I will be happy to assist as much as possible.

We have you scheduled to present to students on 11/15 from 11-2, and on 11/16 to present a seminar to the finance faculty.  We also have a room reserved for you at the Judge Baylor house in Waco for the evening of 11/15.  Besides confirming your visit, I am wondering whether you would recommend that I have my students read any articles in preparation for your talk.  Would it be okay for me to assign your paper with John Martin (forthcoming in the JACF) entitled Transforming Enron Corporation - the Value of Active Management?  Also, would there be a seminar paper that I could distribute for the faculty seminar, or would you prefer to have more of a free flowing presentation along the lines of what you did for me during spring 2000 at LSU?  Finally, if you want me to distribute any other materials to the students or faculty, please let me know.  We are looking forward to your visit!

__label__Save	Introduction Vince:     As way of introduction, I wanted to write a bit about Mars inc. and then about CDS, the unit I head.  Mars is a private company, considered to be the largest privately owned manufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing  its finances, so the best I could do is refer to Forbes estimate of $15 Billion annual revenue and to the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in the business of manufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R)) food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and other products.  Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that emphasizes the long term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-win solutions with its suppliers, customers and partners.  As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of its expenses goes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history of researching those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand (people eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).  CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been very successful, with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage in these arenas. CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports  the purchasing function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is a multidiscipline and multinational team with a lot to offer.  Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile based on manufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in  this area. Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to talk to.  In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing to anything at this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to pursue the opportunity we discussed in the future.  I am looking forward to our video conference call.  Kind regards,  Avi    --------------------------------------- Avi I.

Complaint  My name is Vince Kaminski and I was quoted by Ms. Kristen Hays in her  article on Enron (the link is provided below). Her behavior represents in my view a  violation of ethical standards that every journalist should observe.  I did not talk to Ms. Hays. She did not ask me any questions. She  might have been the lady sitting at my table at the luncheon and she  may have overheard bits and pieces of conversation I had with my  friend. I shall be glad to submit the name of a witness who was talking to me   and sitting next to me through the entire meeting and who walked out with me from  the building.  I am not sure if an organization of your reputation can tolerate similar  questionable practices of collecting information. Eavesdropping on a  private conversation is not an acceptable behavior in a civilized  society. If you would like to endorse such behavior, you should  provide Ms. Hays with a hearing aid.

__label__Save	Summary of Last 6 Months Projects Dear Dale, Stinson & Vince,  I would like to take this opportunity to communicate some information to  summarise the projects of the past six months.  Firstly, by all accounts it  has been an amazing few months for me - I believe that I have kept a large  number of commercial group heads very happy.  However, not all are aware of  my activities, so, many people (e.g. John Sherriff, Richard Lewis, Steve  Young etc.) will not know of everything I have done.  For example the amount  of work that I put into the inflation models and the extent to which I was  critical for the successful building of those curves and the consequent  impact (o7+ million for Q1) and similar large P&L swings for Eastern contract  optionality (short virtual power station) based upon my UK Power Vol Curve  Generator.  For your benefit, I have compiled a shortlist of the main projects worked on  over the past five/six months:  1) Inflation curve modelling (February and March + April internal audit +  June external audit) 2) UK Power Monthly Vol Curve generator & ideas for half-hourly vol curve 3) Nordic Power Monthly Vol Curve generator 4) Energydesk.com models & support 5) Real Options: options to build/extend power stations (e.g. Wessex deal,  Anti-Freeze project) 6) Continental power non-generic options (using arbitrary trader-specified  distributions) 7) Global products: non-generic options modelling and new commodity forward  curve construction (benzene fwd curve from naphtha) 8) Exotic options library upgrade/model test/bug fixes (e.g. testing new/old  Asian models) 9) Continental gas volatility curve construction 10) Communication objective I: two presentations to Enron Europe staff, one  to Oslo office 11) Communication objective II: meetings to gather information and present  results 12) FAS 133: working with internal and external auditors on matching  financial and physical (accrual) hedges - hedge effectiveness 13) Oslo trip: bringing Oslo up to speed on EXOTICA and option valuation 14) Houston Research staff: co-ordinating communication/meetings to maximise  productivity 15) Valuation/Marketing of Power put options for banks that hold senior and  sub debt in merchant power plant  Meeting breakdown:    Initiated by me & booked into meeting rooms  Attended (initiated by others)  Jan  4       5 Feb  6       5 Mar  23       8 Apr  25       4 May  34       5 Jun  12 (so far)       3  I believe I have kept as many commercial groups happy as is possible; it is  clear that I have been critical to large P&L sensitive projects and hope that  I can continue to help enhance earnings going forward.

__label__Save	enrons new weather system, courtesy the research dept. V  Last night, I tested our new system for real-time surveillance and messaging  of the weather, and it delivers the data to desktops throughout the building  more than 6 1/2 minutes before the National Weather Service updates their  webpages. Our current technology was web-scraping these pages via ftp, then  parsing into a database. The impact of these 6 1/2 minutes for the hourly  power traders is enormous- the weather stations upload their data around 53  minutes after the hour, and we can now receive them within 2 minutes later.  We can now re-estimate our nonlinear stack model before the top of the hour,  when hourly power trading begins. Otherwise, we would not have model results  until around 15 minutes after the hour. Notably, hourly power trading is, for  all intents and purposes, concluded by then (they trade for 10-15 minutes and  manage the scheduling for the next 30 or so miutes). So, effectively, we may  now be one *hour* ahead of where we were just a few days ago, in terms of  information. People are very excited up here, from the CTO on down- thanks  for letting it happen.

With your help, we continue to expand the diversity of our host representatives. We especially thank those returning hosts, whose feedback was responsible for several program design changes which we believe will improve the program. Our goal is to continue to build our partnerships and to together create changes that benefit all. Feel free to call upon me to discuss any aspect of the program or special needs.  As a next step in the process, I am asking that you submit, by email, your project proposals no later then September 14, 2001 <mailto:FAP@management.wharton.upenn.edu>  These proposals do not have to be detailed, we just need to know what you are considering. We ask for proposals at this early date because some hosts have expressed the desire to get faculty involved early in the process. We think that is a good idea so faculty will begin to review the proposals in September. This will allow faculty to get involved earlier in the process and the final project scope will be more of a host/faculty collaboration.  As a reminder, projects should be cross-functional in nature with 3, if not 4 of the business function areas; finance, accounting, operations, marketing, management and strategy. Because of the more integrative nature of Tiger Teams,  projects should have strategic implications. Faculty will happily assist hosts in developing these project aspects.  To ensure that the projects yield significant benefits for all participants, we ask hosts to appoint at least one on-site contact person to help define the project objectives, interact with the faculty and student team representatives.  Our tentative FAP calendar can be reviewed at the website: http://fap.wharton.upenn.edu/TigerHost/tiger_host_overview.htm  If there are only particular dates for which the host representatives are available to come to campus for the Kick-Off, Mid-Project Review and Final Presentations, please schedule them as soon as possible, as they will be done on a first-come, first serve basis. Feel free to contact us should you have any questions. We look forward to working with you. Again, thank you for your support of the Wharton School.

__label__DontSave	Newsletter TheMarket for Lemons and the Price of Dishonesty The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics was awarded thisyear to three economi= sts: George Akerlof, Joseph Stiglitz and Michael Spence,who made significan= t contributions to modeling markets with information asymmetry.In many case= s in a given market sellers or buyers may have exclusiveinformation that is=  not available to the counter party. The best-known examplecomes from the [= paper by Akerlof, The Market for Lemons: QualityUncertainty and the Marke= t Mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84,(1970), pages 488-500.  An owner of a used car can form a good idea of the qualityof his vehicle. H= e has much better information if his car is a lemon. As bothgood and bad us= ed car have to sell at the same price - it is impossible for anaverage buye= r to distinguish between good and bad merchandise - they sellers ofgood use= d cars are driven out of the market. Most traded used cars will belemons. O= f course, there are ways to mitigate the problem: an owner of a goodused ca= r may send signal to the buyer by offering him a guarantee or absorbingthe = cost of inspection. Hiring is a similardecision. As Michael Spence wrote in his paper Job Marke= t Signaling,Quarterly Journal of Economics, 87, (1973), pages 355 - 374, to=  hire somebodyis frequently to purchase a lottery ticket. The employer cann= ot directlyobserve the productivity of a potential hire. What he does obse= rve is aplethora of personal data in the form of observable characteristics=  andattributes of the individual, and it is these that must ultimately dete= rminehis assessment of the lottery he is buying. The observable characteri= stics of an individual may be immutable (raceand, generally, sex) but in so= me cases certain attributes are alterable. A candidatecan modify such chara= cteristics as education and job history. Some economistssay, tongue-in-chee= k, that some candidates who attended top schools and spentmany painful hour= s studying useless subjects signal their willingness to dowhatever it takes=  to succeed. Another way to send a signal about ones qualityis to find a j= ob with a top firm at the beginning of ones career and tosucceed in this f= irm before moving on. This provides a useful lesson to anybodywho plans to = be in the labor market at some points in his or her life: thereputation of = the current employer is critical to future employmentopportunities and shou= ld be defended at any cost.

__label__Save	Storage model change: Commodity Delta Dear All,   I change the storage model output to its total value versus the unit value  before. The total value refers to the total present value of the storage capacity at  given status (initial conditions).  The way I calculate the unit value is   (Total PV - S*capacity taken)/total capacity  which could suffer some negative numbers since S, the spot price could be very high.  The correct way is to define the S as the average injection gas  price, but  this would be troublesome to compute.  By switching to total PV, the delta can be interpreted as total commodity  delta for the hedge.  Actually, Duffie also suggested using the total PV as the output in  his audit review.

Visit Toshiba.com for more details.  http://www.nytimes.com/ads/toshiba/index.html   \----------------------------------------------------------/  The Real Wolf  RECKONINGS By PAUL KRUGMAN    ecently I received a letter from an economist I respect, chiding me for my Naderite columns on the California energy crisis. He just didnt believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried Wolf! so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims.   But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state =01* and nobody will believe it.   True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators.   But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isnt workable competition in Californias power market, and that the actions of generators gaming the system have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently =01* and very profitably =01* short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought to be lots of excess capacity.   As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the states power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You cant tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market =01* a view shared by a growing number of other researchers.   Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say apparently because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote, with William Massey =01* the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls =01* voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual.   Whats wrong with FERCs plan? First, it caps prices only in emergency conditions =01* ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not.   Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls megawatt laundering =01* selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to imports from neighboring states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient.   The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there =01* indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts =01* but FERC has ignored all of them.   The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesnt get it, that it just cant bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last weeks action was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls the FERC plan a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout from the looming disaster.   Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief.  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/opinion/29KRUG.html?ex=3D989601563&ei=3D1= &en=3D6a9 00f004b3b1abf  /-----------------------------------------------------------------\   Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the Web, updated throughout the day.

__label__Save	Project with Maria Garcia Vince,  Here is a brief about the project with Maria Garcia.  Promigas, in partnership with others,  wants to acquire $80 MM TVCable  company in Mexico. Promigass ownership would be 25%, i.e. , 20MM.  10MM of it would come from  debt. Enron wants to participate this deal by offer Promigas loan guarantee in  exchange of call options on 50% Promigas equity in TVCable.  Following suggestions have been made:  1) get a market quote for the loan guarantee;     use credit risk model to price the guarantee internally;     need to speak to Vasant  2) find a comparable company, study the volatility     using company value histogram from economics model(crystal ball output),  I can fit a lognormal     distribution, then find the volatility  3)calcalte the call option value, find braek-even strike.

A higher bid was submitted prior to  Wednesdays 1 p.m. MST      deadline in a four-day open season, a pipeline spokesman said. However,  the original      negotiating party has until this afternoon to match the new price and  retain the capacity.        The new bid was for $38 million over one year starting Jan. 1, about $8  million more than      the amount in Fridays announcement ($30 million). One source called it  ridiculous that      someone was willing to pay so much for the space, given that on a  mark-to-market basis      the capacity is worth only about $20-25 million.        Late last week some sources speculated that Duke Energy was the  recipient of next      years package given its large power generation holdings in California.  A marketer      yesterday said he believed Dynegy upped the ante. Rather than go  through all the      hassles they [Dynegy] had at FERC with the 1998-99 package, they let  someone else do      all the work this time and then came in late with a higher bid. That way  no one can      complain that the procedure was tainted. After all, Dynegy has quite a  few power plants      in California to keep fueled, and all of their current FT on El Paso  expires at the end of      this year. Of course, they still could be thwarted if the original  negotiated customer      matches their bid. It may all sound kind of Machiavellian but sort of  makes sense. Other      sources heavily discounted the chances of Dynegy being the new high  bidder, pointing out      that the company made significantly less than expected this year because  San      Juan/border basis differentials narrowed significantly. A Dynegy source  indicated that the      company was involved in the bidding and lost to Duke in the first round.        Regardless of what happens next year, a marketer noted that the Southern  California      border/San Juan basis spread continues to compress as SoCal Gas  withdraws from      storage and east-of-California utilities exercise their peaking  contracts because of cold      weather in the Rockies and elsewhere in the West. From a December index  spread of 29      cents, the border/basin gap was down to about 18 cents Wednesday, she  said.

__label__Save	Alliance Info Alert - FERC Reporting Attached is a summary of recent FERC activities (PDF file) and the weekly  Alliance Express. The following is a summary of the most recent FERC meeting,  followed by a listing of the most recent FERC filings.  In a brief meeting yesterday, FERC approved a Final Rule adopting Section 203  merger filing requirements, generally as proposed, and extended the existing  NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time that the New York market can be  determined to be workably competitive.  At the same time, FERC ordered a  technical conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and  urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next  steps, and deadlines for resolution/implementation.  Additional details are  provided below.  FERC Updates, Streamlines Merger Filing Process  FERC unanimously approved its proposed Order revising the reporting  requirements for mergers.  However, Comm. Hebert did so with reservations, as  discussed below.  Commission staff stated that the Order closely follows the  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking previously issued, but adds more detail and  more certainty to the industry.  Staff stated that the Order is improved over  the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain  entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products.  According to FERC, the draft Order:  -  revises the Commissions filing requirements to reflect existing merger  policy based on FERCs 1996 Merger Policy Guidelines; -  provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market  analyses.  The rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with  potential horizontal competitive concerns.  In addition, the rule establishes  informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses. -  streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise  competitive concerns; and -  reduces the industrys regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing  requirements.  The Rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal  Register.  Commissioner Reaction:  Comm. Hebert expressed reservations that, although he was voting for the  Rule, FERC should not be duplicating the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the  Federal Trade Commission (FTC) market concentration analyses and that FERC  should follow the lead of anti-trust enforcement officials, who could also  analyze mergers faster and more confidentially. He also stated that FERC  should review the filings after the DOJ or the FTC review them, not before,  and that there should be a definite time frame for review.  Hebert did  mention that he was pleased that RTOs and the disposition of transmission  assets would be exempt, that ancillary services would be considered as a  separate product and that the Final Rule opens the door for alternative  market analysis.  Comm. Breathitt supported the Final Rule, stating that it should expedite the  approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the  fact that older, irrelevant requirements have been dropped.  She indicated  that the Final Rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting  the public interest by stating that the process will be efficient yet  sufficient.  The Commissioner said that she was pleased the Final Rule  addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail  competition and one of her main concerns, confidentiality.  Comm. Massey fully supported the Final Rule, emphasizing that it would  improve response time, lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the  industry to better predict Commission actions.  Like Commissioner Breathitt,  Massey was pleased that the Order will allow market modeling analysis that  will better enable FERC to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants  to point to other factors when concentration appears too high.  Massey also  stated that the new Rule includes the ability to address many of FERCs  concerns, such as future mergers when they occur in succession, retail  competition, mitigation by the enlargement of markets through RTOs and  analysis of ancillary services.  In sum, he averred that the Order will  provide FERC with the tools it needs for accurate analysis, while taking into  consideration the rapid changes in the industry.  Chairman Hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was  a very important Rule.  In response to Comm. Hebert, Chairman Hoecker said  that the DOJ and FTC actually wait for FERCs report before issuing their  own, that the anti-trust enforcement agencies rely on FERCs expertise when  reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries.  There is a major  positive connection between industry consolidation and RTOs and that both are  reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work, he noted.  Because the  RTOs enlarge the size of the subject market, he indicated, RTOs will help to  preserve competition.  Therefore, more and larger RTOs should allow for more  mergers, he said.  The Chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that  joining an RTO is a requirement for a merger, but that it would certainly be  viewed favorably.  NYISO Bid Caps Extended Until Ancillary Service Market Shown to be Workably  Competitive  In a 3-1 decision, with Comm. Hebert dissenting, FERC extended the existing  NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be  workably competitive.  At the same time, FERC ordered a technical  conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and urged market  participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next steps, and  deadlines for resolution/implementation.  In so doing, FERC rejected certain aspects of NYISOs September 1 and 8, 2000  compliance filing, submitted pursuant to its May 31, 2000 order imposing a  temporary bid cap through October 31.  The ISOs efforts to correct market  flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had  not yet satisfied the Commissions directives, FERC concluded.  FERC found  that while NYISO has achieved solid progress in certain areas, overall the  ISO has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then  gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the ISOs non-spinning reserve  market by April 2001, as the ISO requested.  Commissioner Reaction:  Comms. Hoecker, Massey and Breathitt all endorsed the order as an imperfect  solution, yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the  ISOs market.  Comm. Hebert faulted the Commission for squandering an  opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls.  Hoecker and Breathitt joined Hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack  of the ISOs progress, but contended that significant outstanding issues must  be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted.  In other action, FERC accepted NYISOs and NEPOOLs proposed Emergency Energy  Transaction Agreement, allowing NYISO and ISO-NE to provide emergency service  to each other (ER00-3638-000);  Stricken items included CAE-16 (NEPOOLs 64th Agreement Amendment proposing  the elimination of In Service and instituting new rules governing certain  import transactions (ER00-3577-000)).                                 == RECENT FERC FILINGS ==  (1) RTO DEVELOPMENTS  *  ISO NE submitted its changes to Market Rule 17, Market Monitoring,  Reporting and Market Power Mitigation, in compliance with the Commissions  July 26, 2000 Order.

__label__DontSave	Re: Presentation slides Hi  John and Vince   I had an opportunity to review the slide  presentation  of  EP   and  here is my assessment.  Bottom  line:   Too  robust by 2005  on merchant plants  being  built; up and running  baseload  and too optimistic  about offshore   gas volume   growth by 2005  as well.  WESTERN MARKETS EP forecast  is  way too high  by  2005 by their assuming 1.4 BCFD of new  power generation gas  demand could be in place in the  west  in such a short  time..This means ..they may  be  forgetting to consider  the tough  NIMBY   siting  hurdles  that stalled  all  but  550 MW  of the  current    10,000 mw of planned  capacity  in the  West.....EP is  assuming not  only   do  80 percent of  these planned plants  get  built  but then they l run   baseload...which is very unlikely. Most  shall be   peaking  or intermediate load in the start  years  which trims that gas use by 50 to 85 percent. WEFA  and   ENE Corp. thinks  the  area gas use growth will be   more like   3.2/  2.9 BCFD  BY 2010 --  but 80 percent of  this  gas  use  happening   late -- not early -- in the time period out  to   2010.  I foresee  the EP  scenario as unrealistic given NIMBY and enviro siting limitations short term  in the West.   WEST  SO CENTRAL  TX/LA    EP  sees the  area  at   2.7 bcfd  by 2005;   way too high  compared  to   WEFA  and  ENE   at   -400 mmcfd  and  +500 mmcfd, respectively BY 2010    and  even  prematurely  high by PIRAs  robust   standard  of   3.5 bcfd  by  2010 . EP  like PIRA assumes   the  gas thermal demand  stays on even  as merchant   plants  get  built;  ENE and WEFA  assume  merchant  kwhs and lower variable costs and better heat  rates   shut in the thermals or  cause them to be  repowered  as combined cycles.   Given where EPs  pipes  are located in the  West  and Texas  and up the  Northeast  this  demand scenario  fits  their wants...so I can see why they  like  this scenario  but   it assumes power generators  will not  act   economically rationally.  NORTHEAST EP sees  2.7 bcfd  by 2005  vs WEFA, PIRA and  ENE   seeing   2.3/2.5/2..6   bcfd  by 2010 .Way premature  for this area to  see such growth  as  385  mmcfd  annually.  They  are real robust on  offshore  gas  being there  to   fill this need too.  GAS  SUPPLY Offshore  supply, which  has  fallen   2.4    bcfd   since    1995   is  expected  to  grow in EPs  forecast  by  3.6  bcfd  by 2005...extremely    unlikely  given the slow  start  Shell  and  Texaco and Exxon offshore   has   been  showing  us so far.  I was  burned  in  my  supply analysis  work in   1999  by Shells  forecasts of their   adding  alone   2  bcfd  to  offshore   deliverability  by  2000  which never  happened --  it fell  500mmcfd   instead !!  so  I do not   give  a lot of  hope right now   for 3.6 bcfd  incremental  gas  by 2005  per  EP.  Cambridge  Energy  says  if all goes   well  the Offshore  overall  will be up  1.1- 1.7  bcfd  by  2005..way less   than  EP  is showing.

__label__DontSave	Alliance of Energy Suppliers Express [IMAGE]     Alliance of Energy Suppliers Express-November 6, 2001   Federal Affairs   ***Proponents of an Energy Bill Continue to Press Democrats for Senate  Floor Consideration***   Proponents of comprehensive energy legislation continued pressure on the  Senate Democratic leadership to bring an energy bill to the floor before  Congress adjourns for the year. The need for a bill was emphasized by the  President, the Secretary of Energy; Senate Republicans; and representatives of  veterans groups, organized labor, and other parties at various venues last  week.   Senate Republicans informed Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) that they  might offer a comprehensive energy bill as an amendment to the economic stimulus  package slated to be considered in the near future if the Leader does not bring  an energy bill to the floor. A strategy previously considered, to attempt to  attach an energy measure to an appropriations bill, could have been blocked as  non-germane.    Meanwhile, Sen. Daschle indicated that Congress might not be able to  conclude its work by Thanksgiving, and possibly would have to return to  Washington following the holiday. Many lawmakers had been focusing on a  mid-November departure date, with the latest continuing funding resolution set  to expire on the 16th.   And across Capitol Hill, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy  Tauzin (R-LA) suggested that there will not be time to complete congressional  action on energy legislation this year, although he commented that the longer  lawmakers were in session, the better prospects would become.   ***Senate Environment Hearing Points To Lack of Consensus On  Multi-Pollutant Measure***    Few signs of consensus emerged last week from a Senate Environment  Committee hearing on S 556, the Clean Power Act, introduced by the panels  chairman, Sen. James Jeffords (I-VT). The chairman advocates resumption of  efforts to develop and pass a bill to significantly reduce emissions of SO2,  NOx, mercury, and CO2 by January 1, 2007.   Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) spoke against the bill, explaining it would  kill our economy, and that the numbers in this bill are devastating. Sen.  Bob Smith (R-NH) said that current laws contain obstacles to cleaning up the  air and stressed the importance of addressing emissions separate from a command  and control system. Agreeing with Sen. Smith, Sen. Christopher Bond (R-MO)  termed S 556 the wrong solution for the problem we face.   EPA Assistant Administrator Jeff Holmstead testified that the approach  offered in S 556 would unnecessarily raise energy costs and jeopardize energy  supplies. Current analysis suggests that it would result in a 32-50 percent  increase in consumer rates, he reported.    Senate Environment plans a second hearing on S 556 in two weeks. This  session will give industry and others an opportunity to testify on the Clean  Power bill. However, with lawmakers considering a target adjournment date of  November 16, it appears that any future action on a multi-emissions bill may  have to wait until the second session of the Congress.    EEI NEWS   ***Americas Electric Utilities Set to Operate Successfully In a Changed  Environment, EEIs President Emphasizes***   Americas shareholder-owned electric utilities are well positioned to  operate successfully in a changed world, EEI President Tom Kuhn said at EEIs  annual Financial Conference. The companies are responding effectively to  emerging business challenges, he indicated, as they continue to advocate public  policies to promote effective competition and help ensure a reliable and  affordable supply of electricity.   The environment in which the industry now is operating, EEIs president  noted, has been significantly affected by the terrorist attacks of September 11.  Todays most important mission is critical infrastructure protection, Mr. Kuhn  said, with a new EEI CEO task force working with a variety of stakeholders to  strengthen security procedures.    Mr. Kuhn also highlighted the industrys financial performance, which  remains strong. Revenues were up approximately 63 percent during the first six  months of 2001, he reported, a trend that continued through the third  quarter.   ***KeySpan Earns EEI Index Award***   The Institute has honored KeySpan Corporation for long-term financial  achievement with the EEI Index Award, in recognition of the companys 265  percent total return over the five-year period 1996-2000. The award was  presented by EEI President Tom Kuhn to KeySpan Chairman and CEO Robert Catell at  the associations 36th Financial Conference, held this week in New Orleans.     The EEI Index of investor-owned electric utilities is a peer group index  that values total return on each electric utility over a five-year period. It is  regarded as a benchmark for long-term financial performance, and is used by over  one-third of EEI member companies in their proxy statements.    For the 1996-2000 period, KeySpans 265 percent return topped the EEI  Index. Other leading performers included Black Hills Corporation, with a return  of 240 percent; MDU Resources, 201 percent; Exelon Corporation, 196 percent; and  Cleco Corporation, 163 percent    KeySpans financial success is impressive, and it stands as a tribute to  its management and employees, Mr. Kuhn commented. Over the past five years,  KeySpan consistently produced improved financial results through key  acquisitions and a growing gas distribution network, pleasing both customers and  shareholders.   ***EEI Expresses Interest in Working With Task Force Established by  President To Bolster Infrastructure***   It is critical for US economic prosperity and energy security that the  barriers to expansion of the nations electric infrastructure be removed, and  EEI and its member companies will work with the Energy Task Force established by  President Bush to accomplish this objective, announced EEI last week.    EEI provided its views in response to the Council on Environmental  Qualitys request for input on the activities of the Energy Task Force  established by Executive Order 13212, signed by President Bush in May. In its  comments, EEI pointed out that with a multitude of federal agencies involved in  the permitting of energy facilities, the Task Force must facilitate effective  coordination among these units and more timely action on the issuance of permits  for generating plants and transmission lines.    MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS   ***FirstEnergy/GPU Merger Closes***   FirstEnergy has announced that its merger with GPU will be finalized  tomorrow. [NANCY, THIS TEXT IS FOR TODAY, IF IT GOES OUT TOMORROW, CHANGE IT TO  TODAY].   With todays closing of our merger, we will begin operating  as a larger, stronger company, better positioned to provide significant benefits  t our customers, shareholders and employees, said CEO H. Peter Burg.      FirstEnergys board of directors now consists of 16 members-10 from  FirstEnergy and six from GPU.     ***Progress Energy Buying Two Plants From LG&E***   Progress Energy Corporation announced that their Progress Ventures unit  plans to buy two electric generating plants in Georgia from LG&E Energy  Corporation for $345 million.  The wholesale energy group is seeking to  expand its reach in the Southeast.  The two natural gas-fired projects,  owned by a subsidiary of LG&E, generate 1,182 megawatts of  electricity.     The deal is subject to regulatory approvals, including approval from FERC,  and is expected to be completed by early 2002.   NEW GENERATION   ***Wisconsin Energy Setting Up Generation Subsidiary*** Wisconsin Energy  has announced that it has created a subsidiary to design, permit, build and own  the new in-state power plants that are proposed as part of the companys Power  the Future strategy. Thomas Fehring, corporate secretary of WEC and Wisconsin  Electric-Wisconsin Gas has been appointed vice president and general manager of  the new subsidiary, which will be named W.E. Power. Mr. Fehring will report to  Richard Abdoo, WEC chairman, president and chief executive officer.  As we  move forward with Power the Future, it is vital that we focus on the flawless,  efficient and effective execution of the plant construction portion of this  plan, Mr. Abdoo said. It is equally important that we continue to focus on our  current utility operations.  The company has announced it will seek to build  2,800 megawatts of new, in-state generation, including two 500 megawatt combined  cycle gas-fired units at the companys existing Port Washington Power Plant  site, and three 600 megawatt advanced technology, coal-based generation units at  its Oak Creek Power Plant site. The Power the Future plan must still undergo  extensive regulatory review on engineering, cost and environmental issues. The  company plans to file the necessary regulatory applications and environmental  documentation associated with building the new electric generation, which will  fall under purview of W.E. Power, later this year.   ***Calpine Plans 1,100 MW California Plant***   Calpine Corporation has announced it has applied to build a 1,100-megawatt  power plant in central California that could be in operation by mid-2004.   The proposed Central Valley Energy Center would be located in San Joaquin,  California.  After the Greater San Francisco Bay Area, this is considered  Californias most electrically vulnerable region, said Curt Hildebrand, Calpine  vice president of business development.

Dear Dr. Kaminski,  Let me briefly introduce myself, I am the Director of Corporate Relations for the School of Engineering at Stanford University.  In this role, I am always on the watch for ways to bring our faculty together with companies that have an appetite for engagement with top tier research institutions.  I believe you know Hill Huntington, who is a senior researcher with Stanfords Energy Modeling Forum.  He suggested I get in touch with you for some ideas about contacts at Enron.  Im in the process of planning a trip to Texas in early May along with my colleague Donna Lawrence, the universitys Director of Corporate Relations.  We were hoping to be able to include a stop at Enron on our itinerary. Right now it appears that Friday, May 4th would work best for us but were at the very beginning of our trip planning.  The purpose of our visit would be to review the current relationship between Enron and Stanford, to give you an overview of current priorities in the School of Engineering, and ask for your help in identifying the best points of contact.  I look forward to hearing from you about your availability,  Sincerely, Susan Hansen     Susan C.

__label__Save	Steve Leppard Hi Vince,  HR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a  noticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to  pay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with  a potential gap - particularly in light of what were seeing in our quant  recruiting effort for credit trading and research.  Id like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and  keep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:  1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  Im not  sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token  salary increase.  2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for  making Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to  EBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy  and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at  year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater  responsibility.  3)  We have some people that were trying to get under long-term (3-yr)  contract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of  these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.   Weve not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer  to keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually  binding him to the job.  Id value your thoughts on this.  Thanks,  Dale Dale Surbey dale.surbey@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com

__label__DontSave	Wharton Event Slides for Your Review To:? Participants (and those who could not attend) ?????? the April 20 Wharton ET Conference  Thanks for participating in the recent Strategic Partnerships conference at Wharton, and contributing to making it such a great success.  We are enclosing with this email a presentation that we unfortunately had to cancel due to time constraints and we wanted to make sure you saw this because it involves some very interesting statistics involving EMAIL and informal organizational structure.  Ruhul Quddus, an MBA student here at Wharton, with advice from several faculty and researchers (including us) has developed a procedure that allows firms to map their informal organization structure using email logs from the email server (note: the content of the emails is NOT required; just the data on who emails whom).  Ruhuls initial results are very interesting and thought provoking in that  they show that consideration of informal organization structure can potentially enhance the value of decision making in situations such as integrating acquisitions and coordinating alliances.? We hope you will look through the attached slides which outline some of his findings.  Ruhuls contact information can be found on the slides.

We have a number of faculty in the business school keenly interested in the energy field and in energy derivatives particularly that it might make sense for you to meet.  Indeed, there are many avenues we could explore.   If your interest lies more in broadband than energy, we might consider possibilities with faculty conducting research in wireless technologies.  Alternatively, I would be pleased to offer our distance-ed program (currently running live interactive video broadcasts via ISDN to London, Frankfurt and Bangalore, India) as a testing ground for internet-based transmissions.

__label__Save	Re: Houston Research Opportunity: Anjam Vince:  Here is an explanation of what a 12 month package for Anjam actually entails. It seems to me that Anjams interest in getting an expat package is mostly  about money.   Based on the UK HRs read of Anjam, they think he will jump.   I have a telephone conference with Anjam at 11:00.  My stance will be 110 is  firm. We will help with the transition via a one time settlement:  flat  rental issues, 500lbs of air shipping for moving furniture, maybe one trip  back to UK a year, but no more.  Re: his concerns of having a place in London  should he want to return, I will say that Vince would be far better at  finding a good spot for you than any HR type, so that part of the package  promise is not particularly important.   Any guidelines for me to follow, coach?  Regards, Grant. ---------------------- Forwarded by Grant Masson/HOU/ECT on 08/11/2000 08:44  AM ---------------------------   Tara Rozen 08/11/2000 05:44 AM To: Grant Masson/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Melanie Doyle/LON/ECT@ECT, Jane Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: Houston Research Opportunity    Grant  Not sure if I told you that I work Mon, Wed, Friday hence the delay in  responding. Sorry if I forgot to tell you! Another contact name in my absence  who will be able to assist is Jane Allen in Houston (cced above).  Three main reasons we try to stay away from assignments to the US for this  type/level of transfer are: 1)cost 2)equitability among other peers  3)difficulty in transferring employee to local package from assignment  package. However, if this is truly a 12 month assignment with no intention of  extension, we would normally do the following:  12 month assignment London base, car allowance,  and benefits and National Insurance contribution  costs (currently 12.2% of all comp compared with 1.45% of all comp plus 6.2%  up to max of $76K of employers US contribution) Housing costs in Houston paid if maintaining housing in the UK (usually up to  $1800 per month for single) Utility costs if maintaining a house in the UK - up to $100 per month Home Leave - two economy trips per year is standard Transportation to/from assignment - economy class Transportation in Houston - we normally give this - up to $40 per day for  rental car in addition to the persons car allowance as they normally do not  require a car in the UK and take the car allowance as a cash benefit whereas  they will require a car  in Houston. Shipment of goods  - 500lbs air Tax Assistance  Disturbance allowance - normally pay approx $1000   So, in terms of costs if you just compare a local US salary of Manager on  $100K to a local UK Manager on o68K the US total cost is approx $120K. The UK  cost is approx $230K. Then if you add the above costs to the assignment, you  will see an even greater increase in cost compared with the local peers, ie  approx $280K compared with $120K. We do have the ability to change the above  in any way as there is no set policy; however, Anjam has already brought up  other peoples assignments and I have a feeling he will do his best to find  out what everyone else is receiving. If we make clear, though, that we are  keeping on UK payroll but not providing any assignment type allowances just  in order for him to maintain his pension contributions for the year and at  which point a decision will need to be made (returns or moves to local US),  then we may be able keep more consistency with your group while maintaining  more reasonable costs. Not sure how you want to play this, though.  Even if he does go on assignment rather than transfer locally, there is still  the issue of whether or not a suitable job will be here at the end of the 12  months. We will always do our best to find suitable postions but we cannot  guarantee it. If he transfers to a local US contract, Enron Europes  responsibility of finding suitable employment is pretty much nil.  I hope this has made things clearer rather than more complicated. I honestly  feel that Ajnam will absolutely not take this position if it is not on an  assignment basis. He made it pretty clear that unless he could stay on UK  payroll for 12 months, he would not transfer.  Call me if you would like to discuss.

Most state electricity boards are bankrupt . MSEB reportedly owes central=  utilities Rs 5,000 crore. They cannot bring themselves to charge many types=  of users for the power consumed, nor can they prevent large-scale theft of=  electricity. Few, including wealthy Maharashtra, have the will to reform state electricity boards and privatise transmission and distribution. Given=  this profile of buyers, private generators demand sovereign guarantees to=  help them tide over default risks. But the guarantees merely insulate IPPs=  against risk. They cannot make SEBs solvent. Yet, India needs power desperately. Maharashtra, India=01,s richest state, experiences power short= ages of around 2,000 MW, about a sixth of its peak needs.  Over time, the hunger for power will only grow. India cannot afford to wait=  for the painful politics of SEB reform to work themselves out. The governme= nt should bring in legislation that allows IPPs to sell power directly to payi= ng customers.This will free IPPs from the clutches of bankrupt monopsony buyer= s. The power trading legislation will have unexpectedly happy consequences for=  the government too.Once IPPs are freed from their onerous obligations to se= ll power to single, mostly bankrupt buyers, their default risks will come down=  substantially. New Delhi and state governments should then scrap the guarantees that they gave IPPs in the past. The combination of power trading, private investments in generation, transmission and distribution, and gradual SEB reform  will create a commercial, workable and competitive power market in India. Anything less=  will be a recipe for disaster.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- -------   State not to give tax sops to DPC for buying naphtha from IOC, (Sanjay Jog)=   Thursday Jan 18 2001  The Maharshtra governments finance department, which is striving to reduce=  fiscal deficit from Rs 9,484 crore to Rs 3,484 crore by the beginning of April this year, has expressed its inability to provide a sales tax waiver = to the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) on the procurement of 1.2 million tonne of=  naphtha from the state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).  Mantralaya sources told The Financial Express on Wednesday that DPC would=  have to pay 4 per cent sales tax. The government, way back in 1995, has modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of napht= ha from Gujarat by electrical companies operating in Maharashtra. The decision=  was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphth= a at reduced rates within the state, government sources added. Sources said=  that these companies had to pay nearly 15.3 per cent sales tax on naphtha=  that was procured from Gujarat. However, following their representation, th= e government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent.  The state finance departments opinion, which would be presented before the=  state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision, deserves special=  significance especially when the state energy department and the loss-makin= g Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) have wholeheartedly supported th= e DPCs cause and recommended the sales tax waiver. DPC, which was asked by t= he Union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country i= n view of excess availability, in its presentation to the state government an= d to MSEB, had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to=  pass on the additional burden on the MSEB which would be ultimately passed = on to its consumers. DPC had also told the state government that it had not pa= id sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from Glencore in the calender year=  2000.  Sources from the state energy department and MSEB have stressed on the need=  for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burde= n. They have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales t= ax exemption to DPC because the IOC, at the behest of the Centre, has tried to=  match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed=  memorandum of agreement with DPC. If the state finance department sticks t= o its views, it may hurt the state as a whole, sources from the state energy=  department and MSEB said.DPC will procure naphtha at Rs 11,050 per ton from=  IOC during the calender year 2001 as compared to the Rs 10,050 per tonne price quoted by Glencore. The naphtha price comprises $175 per tonne free o= n board (FOB), 21.8 per cent of customs duty, 5.4 per cent of sales tax and=  $18.87 of premium.  DPC senior vice president Mukesh Tyagi reiterated that the company has already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on=  naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers. Sales tax is a pass throu= gh and MSEB, which will have to bear the additional burden, will pass it on th= e consumers, he added. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- -------   Centre yet to receive proposal on Enron Thursday Jan 18 2001  CENTRE on Wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from Maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the Enron promoted Dhabol Power Project relating to cost and surplus power. Asked abo= ut the reports that Maharashtra government was sending a proposal that centre=  buy surplus power from Dhabol Power Company through power trading corporation, power minister Suresh Prabhu said we have not received any proposal. We are carefully watching the situation and will await a concre= te proposal before intervening in this matter, Parbhu said on the sidelines o= f greentech environment excellence awards ceremony, here. Asked whether there=  was any possibility of the government asking the Power Trading Corporation = to buy power from the Dhabol Power Corporation, Prabhu replied what will the=  PTC do with the power?  Prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before approaching the centre for payment of dues. MSEB had earlier declined to pi= ck up its 15 per cent stake in phase II of the 1444 mw project. The Enron issu= e has been hanging fire with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board unable t= o clear the dues of DPC as a result of the skyrocketing prices of Naphtha infact MSEB has asked DPC to backdown completely leading to a situation whe= re DPC has stopped production at the facility from the begining of the month.State government has stepped in with support to the tune of Rs 114 crore to enable MSEB to clear the dues for October.

Vince      Steven Leppard 04/17/2000 03:50 AM To: Dale Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Thomas Knudsen  Dale, Vince  As you all know I have attempted to get Thomas Knudsen interviewed as a  result of Prof Lane Hughstons recommendation (Lane is an acquaintance of  Vince and me, and is a very senior figure in the world of quant finance).   Anjam vetoed the idea of interviewing Thomas since he was too old and too  experienced.  Since I felt that Thomas has some merit, I asked Houston to  have an informal chat with Thomas.  Houston wish to pursue the interview  process further, and Anjam has set about setting up the interviews.  Im  somewhat concerned about the way in which Anjam is going about this, since it  seems hes trying to put up barriers to these interviews.  I received a concerned email from Thomas Knudsen this morning in which he  recounts some strange conversations with Anjam.  He says he received a call  from Anjam on Thursday (13th April) evening (outside office hours), asking  how he got his CV into Enron (Id shown Anjam the email and CV back in early  February), and how Anjam could contact him (despite the fact he was  contacting him at that moment).  Anjam then called Thomas on his work number (bad form) on Friday 14th asking  Thomas to come in for interviews on Monday (one working days notice).   Thomas told Anjam he was going on holiday on Wednesday of this week, and that  hed have to see if he could make time given the need to tidy up some things  at work.  He said hed contact Anjam on Monday (today) to confirm his  availability.  Today (17th April) Thomas called Anjam to say he couldnt make it, and that  he wouldnt be able to make it for two weeks (not so serious, he thought,  given that were losing time to Easter anyway).  Anjam told Thomas that the  position might be filled in two weeks time.  Thomas is concerned about missing the boat, and I for one didnt even realise  it was leaving so soon!  Can anyone shed any light on this?

__label__DontSave	Rice Energy Club Roundtable topics Dear John, dear Vincent,   Let me up-date you on the roundtables we decided in the last meeting to focus on during the rest of the academic year.  The original idea was to keep the number of events from 3 to 4 roundtables each semester.  The result of the last meeting with all members was driven by enthusiasm, and as you see below we produced a prolific list of 13 subjects.  Maybe you can help us to narrow down to a reasonable number, 12 events (one we had yesterday) by May 2002 we think are too many.    I also would take this opportunity to update on the ongoing relationships with the most prominent industry in the sectors and have your feedback, suggestion on how to group them in the roundtable. We got great support so far from Reliant, Enron, Mirant, Schell (Coral), Bp, Duke.   El Paso, Chevron-Texaco, Phillips, and Halliburton etc.. also are interested and we will present the club to them as well.  The major challenge for us is not transform the Energy Club in a Finance Energy Club.  At Rice we already have a Finance club and it works very well.  We want first educate about the energy industry in general, and second present the opportunities for MBAs in the industry in different areas, including finance but not limited to.   Topics of Roundtable Meetings:   0) Energy 101  1) Corporate Finance (Treasurer or Controller) 2) Energy Consulting 3) Financial Services (trading, risk management) 4) Origination, Marketing and Sales (Oil, Gas, Electricity) - Marteen 5) Project Development, strategic planning 6) Project Finance 7) Project Risk Management 8) Regulation, Deregulation, and Restructuring - Reliant done 9/17/2001 9) Structuring of Products 10) Supply Chain 11) Telecom - Broadband 12) Venture Capital within energy industry - Brian, Paresh   Thanks in advance for your precious suggestions and I am looking forward to meeting you.

__label__Save	Enron and The New Economy Value Research Lab Gentlemen:  Enron is exploring the possibility of becoming involved in a research  endeavor called the New Economy Value Research Lab. The Lab is the result of  a joint effort between MITs Sloan School of Management and Arthur Andersen  (AA). Its purpose is to develop quantitative valuations of the intangible  assets Wall Street finds increasingly important in the New Economy (Business  Week, 2/7/00). Clearly, as Enron continues to shift from a hard asset to  intangible asset based organization, the question of how to accurately and  appropriate measure and value our intangible assets is becoming increasingly  important.  Last week, Steve Kean, Vince Kaminski, Marie Hejka, and myself met with a  team from AA, the Deputy Dean of the Sloan School, and MITs lead  accounting/finance professor to discuss the intent of the Lab, expected  outcomes, and how Enron may be involved. Post that meeting, the decision was  made to continue to explore participation in the Lab. Enron now needs to 1)  define our corporate measurement and valuation process needs, and 2) identify  value attributes important to Enron and the industries in which we operate.  Once defined, a follow up meeting will be held with MIT and next steps will  be determined.  Your expertise and assistance could significantly impact the inputs and  outcomes of these next steps. Please schedule time on Tuesday August 1 from   2:00 to 3:30 to attend the next meeting, during which we will begin to  identify needs and define value attributes. Location will be EB 49c4. Please  notify me if you are unable to attend.  Lastly, to assist with preparation for this meeting, I am attaching notes  from a recently published book entitled  Cracking the Value Code: How  Businesses Are Creating Wealth in the New Economy (May 2000, Boulton, Libert,  Samek - Arthur Andersen).    Should you like more information on the Lab, previous meeting, book or other,  please feel free to contact me.  I look forward to meeting you.

__label__DontSave	Re: calculating bid-ask prices Rich, Thanks for your response. Sorry for the long e-mail. I did not expect to be this long but it kept getting longer and longer while I wrote it. We can set up a meeting to discuss about it instead of reading this long e-mail.  You know, any individual product has two risk components---unique risk and market risk. Most products in energy industry have very high market risk and very low unique risk. (For example, a price of gas produced from Texas is highly correlated with the Henry Hub spot price.) Since the market risk plays an important role in the energy commodities prices, people buy and sell commodities or their derivatives mainly for hedging purpose---to reduce their market risk.   However, the movie market is quite different than other commodity markets. The Gross Box Office receipt of The Little Mermaid has low correlation with the sum of Gross Box Office receipts of all movies releasing at the same period. An individual movie has very high unique risk and very low market risk. If you remember, the consultant last Friday said that if we own about 15 movies, their combined total revenue would be pretty much accurately forecasted. That means movies market risk is low and hedging is not important comparing to diversification.  Since the unique risk plays an important role in the movie market, I would expect that most of our customers would buy and sell for diversification purpose, not for hedging purpose. The producer of some movies would sells part of their movies and buy part of the other movies to diversify their unique risk.   I think we are going into the right direction by creating this movie market so people who long on a small set of movies can sell part of them and buy some parts of other movies. The buyers and sellers in this market can all just be the people who naturally long on some slates of movies. They will sell some of their own and buy some of others.  I think the idea on grouping a small number of movies to increase liquidity is good but we need to make sure that diversification can still be done through this market.  If Enron wants to take some position, I would recommend that we must be diversified enough (15+ movies as the consultant said). We should avoid taking a position on a small number of movies. Otherwise, we will be just an inefficient gambler. (Like putting all the money into only one or two stocks. We could have made the same expected return with a lot less risk by investing in S&P500.)  For your questions about the bid-ask pricing system that I proposed in the previous e-mail, if there are no buyers, the tentative bid-ask prices would be very low. So we tell the seller to reduce their selling price to this level if they still want to sell to us. (We can set our bid price to be low enough by subtracting its unique risk premium---insurance premium--so now we can take this position and behave like an insurance company. But we need to have (or expected to have) a significant numbers of similar deals of other movies.)  I agree that leaving open orders for several days might be a problem. We can set the bidding period to be just only 1 day (e.g. every Monday) and everything is cleared at the end of the day.   I have not seen other markets using this dynamic bid-ask pricing system and the idea was just came up by myself, so I believe it is new. I plan to write a memo explaining the details of this system and send it to you.  Dear everyone, please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks, -Chonawee    From: Richard DiMichele@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 04/25/2001 01:46 PM To: Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Key Kasravi/Enron Communications@Enron Communications   Subject: Re: calculating bid-ask prices     Chonawee:    Thanks for your input.  This is similar to what I was thinking.  Our prices would be indicative only.  We could take positions, but initially would try to find the other side of any deal wed do.  Thats why weve been spending a lot of brain cells trying to come up with an exhaustive list of the natural buyers and sellers.  To the extent we make the product more generic (e.g., a slate of movies as opposed to an individual picture) we may drive out more liquidity.   Im a little unclear on the settlement.  What if there are no buyers - do we tell the sellers they didnt get done?  Also, a buyer or seller would have to give us an open order (which might be okay).  However, leaving an order open for several days might be a problem.  Are you aware of any other markets which trade in the way you suggest?

Otherwise, if our forecast is not consistence with the market, we may have an imbalance in the bid-ask orders and we may end up taking some positions. You know, as Russ and Martin pointed out, we cannot fight with the studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the price easily.  One way to ensure the balance of the bid-ask orders is to embed an exchange system inside our bid-ask prices front end. Each week, we have a trading period. During the period, instead of posting bid-ask prices, we post tentative bid-ask prices, then we ask our customers to submit their acceptable buying or selling price. These tentative bid-ask prices get updated and are shown to the public. Of course, customers can revise/withdraw their bids anytime during the trading period. At the end of the period, we calculate and post the final bid and ask prices. The seller who submits lower selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price. The buyer who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask price. Next week, we repeat the same process.  This way, we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a broker where we dont take any position at all. We make profit from those bid-ask spread. We dont have to worry about forecasting accuracy and insiders trading because we dont have to take any position. Let the market be the one who decides the price.   If we maintain our net position as zero, at the end, when all the actual gross box office numbers are reported in those publications, our customers with open long/short positions are perfectly matched. Using the mark-to-market charge can reduce credit risk.

I think that we, as a market maker, can reduce our credit risk (risk of default) if we do the mark-to-market charging. That is, each week when we release a new expected value of the gross box office receipt, we balance all the opening positions the same way as in a regular future market. This way, we can give margin calls to the couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money. In the last paragraph, I think the gross box office can also be determined from the market itself (i.e., if there are lots of buyers, our offer price should go up.) We can offer other derivative products such as options as well. -Chonawee           <Embedded StdOleLink> Chonawee Supatgiat chonawee.supatgiat@enron.com enron.com Richard DiMichele <Richard DiMichele/Enron Communications@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS> richard.dimichele@enron.com  Key Kasravi <Key Kasravi/Enron Communications@Enron Communications> key.kasravi@enron.com Stinson Gibner <Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT> stinson.gibner@enron.com  Martin Lin <Martin Lin/Contractor/Enron Communications@Enron Communications> martin.lin@enron.com  Jim Fallon <Jim Fallon/Enron Communications@Enron Communications> jim.fallon@enron.com  Vince J Kaminski <Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT> vince.kaminski@enron.com

As it turns out, Christian left RAC in April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that theyd only been around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.     From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

One problem on that front is still how much producers  want to charge the state for electricity. As we reported last week, Davis and  his aides   want to pay around $50 to $55 dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want  about $75. Treasury Secretary Summers has suggested an auction as the best  way to   determine the price, but California officials are taking a less free market  approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over long-term  contracts.  Our sources in Washington, Sacramento, and California are increasingly of the  view that Governor Davis is positioning his government to establish long-term  power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the  utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term.  This weeks legislative  activities in Sacramento will create the vehicle to do so.   State credit backing  purchases of power would obviate the need for super-priority borrowing to  finance power  purchases after utility bankruptcy.  1. Audit- Untangling Utility Relationships  California officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment  front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that  half of the $9 to $12 billion  the utilities say they owe is actually owed to  themselves for power they bought from their corporate relations  This strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both  the power-generating and power-distributing companies under a  holding company umbrella. Of course, that means that some of the power PG&E  and Southern California Edison bought at highly inflated prices  was bought from themselves.     But it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations. Sources confirm that  Davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part  of any  potential solution. He told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to  use state credit to eliminate the risky debt premium that PG&E  and SCE are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and  that he is willing to extend the current 10% rate increase  utility customers are paying far beyond the initial 90-day deadline. In  return he is demanding that the companies prepare to share the  burden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension.  2. Debt Restructuring- Guarantees, but No Direct State Money   Davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $12 billion in back  debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up during a 90-day forbearance period (whether that period has been agreed to by  all creditors is not something we are clear about right now). Davis idea, as he laid it out in the meeting, is to use the forbearance period to securitize  the debts and sell them against the utilities forward rate base or by  establishing a medium-term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees.    In both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without  direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to paydown their debt. One of the reasons Davis wants to stay close to the  $50-$55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can  pay down this debt. There is a strong chance that Davis will agree to use state  guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations, but he remains opposed to using direct state money. This frustrates both Clinton  administration and utility creditors, but Davis has not yet shown much  flexibility.  3. Eminent Domain/Reregulation    Perhaps most frustrating to the Washington DC free market crowd at Treasury  and the White House was the continued comfort Davis and his group of political   advisers have with non-market solutions to the energy crisis. Although  the Governors aides actually believe the weapon is more a way to force  eventual   agreement, than an actual solution, the talk returns frequently to these  non-market mechanisms. We have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by  the   Tuesday deadline. If we make no progress. If this thing looks like it will  turn into a genuine crisis, then we will use our powers of condemnation and  we will re-take   the plants and equipment and run them ourselves, a close political aide to  Davis said. We will absorb the plants, the transmission lines and the  reserved parking   places of the executives. The legislature would agree in a second.

I am wondering whether research is looking into the application  of extreme value theory to power and esp. to weather. In a recent news  article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t_max, t_min,  etc.   I am in particular referring to the news article below:  http://213.219.22.254/i-wex/resources/ef290600.htm  In the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for  t_max, t_min, or below or above precipitation structures. The choice in the past has been the burn analysis on historical data. However, we are in  particular interested in the extreme events, and the application of EVT could  provide a meaningful tool for the analysis.   Has the research group looked into the application of EVT to weather? EVT has  a long history of application in hydrology (which would cover parts  of the precipitation structures...). Also, research (esp. at ETH in Zuerich)  is indicating the application of EVT to V@R....   Thank you!    Regards, Christian Christian Werner christian.werner@enron.com enron.com

He said that he generally understands the logic of the deal but  simply wants the risk management discipine applied to analzing the position (a  reiteration of what Rick Buy had said in our meeting today).  I would simply  ask Vinces team to take a quick look tommorow at valuing the ships as stand  alone positions with a guess at the volatility based on historical price  movements.   This would be much easier than the Rainbow option approach and would allow us to roughly  look at the value of the options on the other two ships.  In other words we  could look at two ship  long positions with some implied volatilities and  also estimate daily VARs on the ships as if they were mark to market  (although I agree with David that we will not likely be able to mark the  ships because they will be treated as leases).  John   John ---------------------- Forwarded by John Sherriff/LON/ECT on 22/05/2000 19:05  ---------------------------   Joe Gold 22/05/2000 18:58 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: Exmar Purchase Decision   John,  After spending a few minutes with our shipping experts in the coal and oil  groups, I have a slightly different angle on the Exmar LNG vessel decision.   I would ideally like to spend the time to analyse this purchase as we do  power and gas positions.  Unfortunately, we do not have that luxury and  sometimes, in absence of true analytics, the most rudimentary measures can  provide the best decision tools.  Here is how we would make the decision:  1)  Our shipping expert confirms that $140 million for a 135,000 ton ship  represents a good price relative to new build costs over the last three years  and that quotes have been trending up past that number recently.  He also  confirms that the current trough is the result of the default of several Far  East buyers and that new LNG orders and other ship building (cruise liners)  have reduced the over capacity.  His experience and historic analysis has  suggested that the pricing cycle for LNG ships lasts for a significant  period.  New efficiency measures should reduce new build prices (and allow  for a lower trough), but not by an extreme amount versus the $140 million  cost of this vessel.     Pierre normally likes to roll time charters; however, this is difficult in an  illiquid shipping market like LNG.  He would purchase this ship if the LNG  shipping book were his to manage.  He estimates the ship could be sold in a  distressed sale for $110 million and could be potentially time chartered on a  long term basis at a value of up to $200 million.    2)  Our development teams in Spain, Italy and Turkey have been trying to  solve the big question - gas.  In each country, the key to developing a  merchant plant is securing gas flexibility or at least securing negotiating  leverage with the monopoly gas supplier.  It is questionable whether or not  this decision will have an immediate impact on Arcos.  The plants time line  and the realities of the LNG supply market may require that we commit to Gas  Natural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas can be secured.   The shear  threat of being able to bring spot or term LNG to these markets will improve  our negotiating leverage and/or allow us to create flexibility.  Going  forward, however, other potential plant opportunities in Spain, and elsewhere  in the Med region, may have the capacity to utilise these vessels.   I think  that this flexibility is worth at least $25 million to me.  3)  I would summarise:   Upside   $60 + $25 = $85 million      Downside           ($30) + $25 =             ($5)  million  I would do it.  I will leave the rest to you.

__label__DontSave	Re: American type swaption calculations. David:   On #1, I would say the problem is not with the calculation part, but with  the market information, or lack thereof (i.e., illiquidity). The gas desk is  responsible for the supplying prices and volatilities. It is upto them to  decide how they want to account for illiquidy: change the bid/offer spreads  accordingly, or add hedging costs, or something else. And on the  correlations, they do matter but not as much as volatility or price. Since  these are correlations for the same underlying at the same location across  time, I think we can make some reasonable assumptions and compute them.   Regarding #2, I dont agree with the concept of a market top. What the desk  does with the options is to hedge them. And the way to hedge them is hedge  teh delta and exercise the options optimally at the same time.   Finally, I dont think we can use a 2-year swap as a proxy for a 10-year  swap. Longer term prices and volatilies are driven by the cost of production  and economic variables and their uncertainities. Those dont necessarily  reflect the shorter term issues.

Sign up today at: http://nww1.com/go/foc69.html ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Todays focus: Network management goes open source --------------------------------------------- By Phil Hochmuth  A beta version of Open Network Management Softwares Bluebird management tool last week was released to the open source community for testing in network environments.  Bluebirds creators intend the software to be an open-source alternative to large network management platforms, such as Tivoli, HPs OpenView and Aprismas Spectrum. Bluebird uses standards-based technologies - including Java in the core application engine and XML in the reporting and interface modules - which make applications less bulky and more customizable than proprietary network management platforms, OpenNMS developers claim.  Also, as with all open-source programs, the source code is freely available, allowing users to modify and customize the software even further.  Bluebird runs with PostgreSQL 7.0, a freely available SQL database popular with open-source software users. Bluebird is also compatible with the Oracle8i database.  Bluebird 0.4 is based on SNMP, and is designed to manage small networks of up to 500 networked devices. The software requires no agents, or monitoring software, to run on the devices it monitors. This could help to make the deployment and maintenance of the system easier than agent-based management products.  The Bluebird software performs an array of management tasks, such as discovering TCP/IP devices in a network, device filtering, and service-level monitoring for enforcing service- level agreements from a service provider. Reporting tools allow users to make charts and reports about their networks performance over a period of time. The software includes a Java2 real-time reporting console that gives users a live view of events and traffic patterns in a network.  A calendar function is included, which can be used to schedule network tasks, such as system backups and automated software upgrades.  OpenNMS software is based on Java2, so it can run on an array of platforms, including Linux, Windows NT/2000 and Sun Solaris.  OpenNMS expects Version 1.0 of Bluebird to be released in the first quarter of 2001. The production version of the software will have a distributed architecture, where multiple Bluebird servers are deployed and tasks are divvied up among distributed machines.

This file gives more information than the previous (yesterday)  one. As the one before, source for this file is Megawatt daily, it includes  On-Peak and Off-Peak prices and you can also see daily data that was  converted to monthly average data. There are two types of averages prices:  average and weighted average. Weighted average takes into account number of  transactions of certain price.  For example: PJM had average price of $53.61 and weighted average price of  $53.15 in August , it means that there were more transactions of lower price  than higher.  Also, Megawatt Daily has its own methodology and I am attaching  it with this message.

__label__DontSave	RiskNews Update - 25/01/2002 Dear Subscriber,  Welcome to RiskNews Update - 25/1/2002  The focus of investigations into the collapse of Enron turned to its derivatives trading business this week. Expert testimony in a US Senate hearing Thursday by Frank Partnoy, a professor in the University of San Diego School of Law, warned that profits the firm attributed to its derivatives operations may have been inflated due to systematic problems with the way Enron valued its positions and recorded them in its trading book. But Partnoy - who is currently researching a book about Enrons fall - failed to provide any hard evidence. Enron spokesman Vance Meyer refused to address the matter, stating Enron would not offer counterarguments to each testimony. To vote on whether derivatives played a key role in Enrons demise, visit http://www.risknews.net.  Meanwhile, Citibank and Soci?t? G?n?rale will sell warrants for the first time in the North American retail market on Monday, via the Bourse de Montr?al. The expansion is significant for the banks, both of which are market leaders in the warrants business, as it could open the way to selling the products to the US retail market. A tight US regulatory environment currently impedes the selling of warrants in the US.  Operational risk software and data vendors Raft International and OpVantage plan to integrate their respective op risk applications, Raft Radar and OpVar. US-based OpVantage was established in April last year when PricewaterhouseCoopers and NetRisk merged their op risk offerings. The firms believe the joint offering should allow users to manage their entire operational risk process from developing and collecting risk indicators through to calculating capital-at-risk.  On the people front, Lehman Brothers lured a 15-person equity barrier options team from rival CSFB. The move is the largest hiring spree in Lehmans two-year drive to boost its equity derivatives capability. The team will be led by Jerry Guthrie. Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, hired Michel Iskander to head its OTC derivatives structuring business. Iskander, who has worked at JP Morgan since 1993, will manage a team of about 10 and report to Toshio Okumura.

So here is an outline of the R&R and required technology to support the administration of factor loadings:     << File: FactorLoadingProcess.doc >>   Broadly, I have assumed that Global Risk Ops can run the process. However, exceptions can take one of two forms:  Large jumps in VaR due to bona fide changes in correlations; Pathologies in the matrix construct supporting factors;  For either, tools are required for users to examine the exceptions and make changes as necessary (generally Global ops in the former case and RAC/Research in the latter).  Note that the IT Development group has no part in this business process beyond building the tools.  Lets use this as the starting point to develop a business model that makes this work.

Then I calculated normalized log-returns:  [ return(t)-ave(t) ] / vol(t)  and compared the results to normal distribution.   I COULD NOT FIND Fat Tails!   Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large  returns more frequent than normal),  which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).

Also, Paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be  discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values. 2.  I would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree  approach to a one-dimensional integration, perhaps using a quadrature  method.  This may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities. 3.  Edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for  anything.

__label__Save	California Update 5/4/01 If you have any questions, please contact Kristin Walsh at (713) 853-9510.  Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is  reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would double dip into  the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.   Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of  contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would eat the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowens language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).    According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.   Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.   Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B    Bear Stearns  $625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:  5.38% Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis.   SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.    The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

I think that  I have most of it right.  If there is anything wrong or missing please let me  know.  Please dont share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of  Enron.  Regards, Tim  New Cap Specifics On 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a  new price cap methodology. The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as  can be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to  achieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date  might be. The new price cap methodology will remain in place until: Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven  to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions. Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal. Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the  following heat rate table:   Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap   <25 GW   10,775   $43.10   25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70   30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90   35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90   >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment. Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps. The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior  to the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISOs two day-ahead  system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior  to the hour of delivery.  FERC Context FERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000. The ISO has asserted that they dont need FERC authority since it is a bid  cap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of  electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices. The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.   FERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days  after their authority expires) FERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its  206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We dont know  what they will find or what they will propose. The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will  likely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on  11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral  comments. Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price  caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations. It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into  effect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC  extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from  the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.  Impact of Price Caps The attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at  different gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets  would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to  say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap  because we dont know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the  cap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below. Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.    Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new  price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices. Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets. Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.   For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January  through September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January  through September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400  from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual  observations. We created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the  calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices  for each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each  hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour  could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly  average cap value! The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000  NYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power  prices which are in excess of the proposed cap.

Thanks,  Jeff        Enron Energy Services    From:  Richard L Zdunkewicz                           05/03/2001 09:56 AM    To: James L Bouillion/Enron@EnronXGate, Paul Clayton/Enron@EnronXGate, Vince  J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: James Harris/HOU/EES@EES, Jeff Forbis/HOU/EES@EES, Richard B  Jones/HOU/EES@EES, Cheryl Brashier/HOU/EES@EES  Subject: Risk Profile and Liability Mitigation Product  Please find attached a Scope of Services document and a list of projects  which have been implemented with current EES customers.  The Scope of  Services document is designed to show the types of projects, operations and  maintenance, and facilities management services that EESO typically offers to  its customers based on their industry segment.  The projects and services  offered are very similar across segments and customers, but their level of  deployment varies significantly from segment to segment.    Certain segments were grouped together because the EESO offering would  feature similar assets and services. SIC Codes were given for each segment to represent the types of customers  that comprise each segment.  The list of projects represents general categories from which more specific  projects will be tailored to fit the clients needs.  This project list  represents assets that have been approved by the DSM Desk and was queried  from PCCS. The Operations and Maintenance services can be applied to any energy-related  assets and was compiled from term sheets and IAM.  Generally those activities  have been limited to a few industrial outsourcing deals including Springs,  Polaroid and recently Eli Lilly. Facilities Management is usually outsourced via IPT or through the adoption  of existing vendor contracts and can involve repair and maintenance for all  assets.   Generally this type of activity has been focused on the retail/real  estate segment.      Cheryl, pls set up a meeting with Harris, Clayton, Bouillion, Jones and  Kaminski to discuss this and an action plan to develop a liability mitigation  product.  I will re-present the original product concept at the meeting.   Would like to see the meeting take place late next week.  Thanks.

__label__Save	Re: LNG May 19 decision Vince - thanks for the update.  What I am not sure of is what if any decision  has to be made on May 19.  It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals  have already been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or  two.  John     Vince J Kaminski 15/05/2000 17:14 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rick  Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision    John,  This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.  1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH  and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the  decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island  project (please, see point 2).  2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest  (Sally Becks organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island  transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enrons LNG-related  positions   in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is  meeting to close a few remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.  A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:  a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island  facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.  The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are  setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and  coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.  b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension  option of 5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for  such a long tenor. This is   essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread  and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.  One solution would be to  cover, lets say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the  first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.  c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a  big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market.  d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island  deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions. Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail  that  correlates very well with Brent.   Vince    John Sherriff 05/14/2000 01:40 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: LNG May 19 decision   Vince  I havent spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.   Anyway with Greg moving to his new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the  Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.  I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for  LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far  away).  Anway I understand this is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you  please let me know where you stand now?  I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in  the next couple of days and if you have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.

Ill discuss it with Mike and Eric this morning.  Also agree that  well almost assuredly save money in the long run by building a more robust  model off more comprehensive data to start with.  Cheers, Scott     Amitava Dhar 26/04/2001 21:23 To: Mike Mumford/LON/ECT@ECT, Eric Kirkpatrick/EU/Enron@Enron, Scott  Salmon/EU/Enron@Enron cc: Iris Mack/ENRON@enronXgate, Vasant Shanbhogue/Enron@EnronXGate, Vince J  Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Craig Chaney/Enron@EnronXGate   Subject: Short Term Private Firm Model: Static historical  snapshot+performance data for model development  Mike, Scott, Eric,  After brainstorming and discussing further on data here, we think that our  final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows: We need bankrupt, default and nondefault (which covers nonbankrupt) accounts  with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following  the latest snapshot.  Monthly performance indicator need to be available for  the entire 12 months performance period.  We will need all the bankrupt and  default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights. For the purpose of model validation, we will need data with above specs  covering 16 months of performance.  This means that we will need rolling (4  quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data for 4 monthly shifts:  Input snapshots           Performance 1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end, 1999 December end   12  month end performance for Jan 2000 through Dec 2000 1999 Feb end, 1999 May end, 1999 August end, 1999 November end    12 month  end performance for Dec 1999 through Nov 2000 1999 Jan end, 1999 Apr end, 1999 July end, 1999 October end     12 month end  performance for Nov 1999 through Oct 2000 1998 December end, 1999 Mar end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end    12  month end performance for Oct 1999 through Sep 2000  We will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator, if available during the  performance period.  Our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90+  days delinquency on any trade credit. We have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big  picture, it makes sense to spend  the extra amount to get the right data for  analysis. Please let me know your thoughts.  This will require D&B to give us a  modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly.

Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp.

Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.  Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enrons research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enrons research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs.   We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enrons eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the users desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.

IN THE NEWS  Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday.  In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year.  We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

I have also been responsible for negotiating and renegotiating enduser contracts for another like term at an average margin well above the then current market place.  I have also been responsible for purchasing supplies for resale for the companies, which I have represented.  During my tenure as a Natural Gas Marketer I have amassed a database well in excess of 20,000 qualified potential endusers, which contains all pertinent data to be most effective in the marketing of Natural Gas and potentially Retail Electricity.  Attached you will find a resume of myself outlining in more detail my responsibilities for the companies which I have been employed by.  After you have had the opportunity to review my resume I would like the opportunity to discuss, in person or by phone teleconference my potential employment opportunities with your company.
