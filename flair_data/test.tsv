__label__Save	correlation matrix reduction Zhiyang,  Got your message.    As we discussed, the best way to breakdown the big correlation matrix between  different location indices is through cluster analysis.  The idea is to  select major hubs and the satellite markets.  By establish the correlation between the  hubs and correlation between the satellites and the hubs, the big matrix can be  significantly reduced.    Then the traders only need to input the correlations between the  hubs.  This technique has been applied in our Value at Risk system.  You may talk to  Tanya to find out the details.

__label__Save	Storage model change: Commodity Delta Dear All,   I change the storage model output to its total value versus the unit value  before. The total value refers to the total present value of the storage capacity at  given status (initial conditions).  The way I calculate the unit value is   (Total PV - S*capacity taken)/total capacity  which could suffer some negative numbers since S, the spot price could be very high.  The correct way is to define the S as the average injection gas  price, but  this would be troublesome to compute.  By switching to total PV, the delta can be interpreted as total commodity  delta for the hedge.  Actually, Duffie also suggested using the total PV as the output in  his audit review.  I have attached the XLL model below.  Zimin Zimin Lu zimin.lu@enron.com enron.com Kenneth Parkhill kenneth.parkhill@enron.com Stinson Gibner stinson.gibner@enron.com

Visit Toshiba.com for more details.  http://www.nytimes.com/ads/toshiba/index.html   \----------------------------------------------------------/  The Real Wolf  RECKONINGS By PAUL KRUGMAN    ecently I received a letter from an economist I respect, chiding me for my Naderite columns on the California energy crisis. He just didnt believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried Wolf! so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims.   But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state =01* and nobody will believe it.   True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators.   But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isnt workable competition in Californias power market, and that the actions of generators gaming the system have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently =01* and very profitably =01* short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought to be lots of excess capacity.   As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the states power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You cant tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market =01* a view shared by a growing number of other researchers.   Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say apparently because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote, with William Massey =01* the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls =01* voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual.   Whats wrong with FERCs plan? First, it caps prices only in emergency conditions =01* ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not.   Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls megawatt laundering =01* selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to imports from neighboring states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient.   The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there =01* indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts =01* but FERC has ignored all of them.   The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesnt get it, that it just cant bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last weeks action was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls the FERC plan a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout from the looming disaster.   Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief.  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/opinion/29KRUG.html?ex=3D989601563&ei=3D1= &en=3D6a9 00f004b3b1abf  /-----------------------------------------------------------------\   Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the Web, updated throughout the day.

__label__DontSave	Re: HSX volume info FYI. update on movie trading business.  I change my mind. At first I though that we should focus on customers who want to diversify their unique risks. But now I feel that, at this moment, the make-sense people are not easy to find in reality. (Even myself who own Enron stock, not Dynergy.) There are more risk takers than risk diversified people. So I think speculators might be our customers in this movie business. -chonawee   ---------------------- Forwarded by Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron on 05/02/2001 11:23 AM ---------------------------   Chonawee Supatgiat 05/02/2001 11:23 AM To: Russell Woody/Enron Communications@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS, Key Kasravi/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Richard DiMichele/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Martin Lin/Contractor/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Greg Woulfe/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: HSX volume info     Thanks, Key, for the volume information. Because HSX is a fake market, I think this indicates that there are lots of speculators out there in the movie trading business. So I believe speculators might be one of our major customers. (Like stock markets, a (big?) part of brokers profits are from speculators commissions.)  I know the diversification is a good thing to do but may be hard to do in reality. Even for myself, who is working for Enron and owning Enron shares, I would not buy Dynergy stocks even if it makes sense to do that for reducing my unique risk...  In stead, I buy Enron shares, so I am a speculator (risk taker) myself...   Regarding moral-hazzard/information-asymmetry issue in the movie business, the market price will reflect this risk. In addition, I think we can 1) try not taking any position or 2) have a diversified portfolio of movies.   If we operate as a broker and maintain balanced books, one question is how much we have to invest to create these markets...

Personally, I am blown away by the large membership HSX claims.   Even if they have a decent percentage of these numbers, that would suggest that movies and the related industry is becoming sport as well as entertainment.  I guess the fact that you can already find on the front page of your newspaper such information as weekend box office receipts suggests that a lot of people really are interested in movies beyond the content.

__label__Save	 Folks,  Attached is a conservative (and fairly rough) estimate of the size of the  petrochemicals and refining market that is potentially exposed to prolonged  drought in southern Texas which could result in extremely low riverflows and  possible curtailed production.   The total annual revenue generated by these  assets is no less than $20B and could be substantially higher as the  estimated capacity on some of these facilties is likely understated and other  facilties not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable.  Note that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial  complexes from Houston northward and eastward as they are much less likely to  experience such a drought-induced interruption.  The only facilties  identified thus far lie on or near the following rivers: Brazos, Colorado,  Navidad, Guadalupe, and Nueces.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments as we work to determine  whether or not a low riverflow insurance product is viable.

One item of note is that the  correlations used to book the spread options have dropped significantly from  what was being used a year ago (see charts below).   I also remember that  John Mee was using even higher correlations when he ran this book.  In fact  he wanted to book options with a correlation of 1.0, but our model would not  allow it, so he was using 0.999.  We are currently calculating historical correlations for you as well.   If  you want, Vince and I can review this with you at the end of the day.   Just  let me know what time would be convenient.  --Stinson x34748 Stinson Gibner stinson.gibner@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com 
__label__Save	Wharton Event-June10-Insead Vince,  Bryan has been unable to find anyone suitable to attend this symposium on  Saturday, so has suggested I attend, which I am happy to do. My only  reservation is that my knowledge of this area is very limited, so it is  likely I would just be an observer, rather than a participant. Anyway just so  that I am adequately prepared could you briefly describe our current  relationship with this project, and also suggest any reading, like a magazine  or paper, that would quickly aid my understanding of the topics to be  discussed.

I wanted to ask you for a favor (on a very short notice). We are talking to  the Wharton School about setting up a relationship with them and getting involved in one or  more  research projects with them.  One of the potential  topics is emerging technologies. The Wharton offers  a  symposium in Paris on June 10  on High Tech Acquisitions  and it would make a lot of sense if you (or somebody from London you could identify) could attend and help us to  evaluate the usefulness of this project.  I am enclosing the message from the person in Wharton running this program.

Per our discussion, Ive enclosed three files that include an invitation, agenda and rsvp form for the June 10 symposium on High Tech Acquisitions at Insead.  If you or the individual(s) who will be attending have any questions, please email:  Phanish Puranam at: PHANIS20@WHARTON.UPENN.EDU or you can call him at 215-898-1231.  This initiative will be expanded during the coming year and I believe that Enrons involvement will give the company access to some of the early research in progress as it unfolds, and of course, if you become involved as a partner in the Emerging Technologies Program you would have opportunities to help guide the direction of the research which is one of the partnership benefits.  Our next upcoming events are scheduled for:  Friday, September 8 WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET? This is a faculty update day with industry partners also invited. We will co-sponsor this with Whartons major e-Business initiative. Major issues addresses include New Economics of the Web and Internet, Anywhere.  Friday, October 20 FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE, SHAKEOUTS & SURVIVAL STRATEGIES Designed by the ET core group and presented in collaboration with the e-Commerce Forum.  As I indicated during our discussion, participation in the Emerging Technologies Management Research Program is by invitation and on behalf of our core faculty, I am pleased to extend an invitation for Enron to join the program.  To assist in your decision, we recommend having a representative attend the symposium in Paris on June 10 to test drive the program.  Ill send you a formal invitation which you are free to accept at your convenience, should you agree that Enrons participation in the ET Program would be of value.

__label__Save	Weather team & Stinson Gibner John,   I hope you had a good Easter weekend. I typically take Monday Easter off but   this year too much was going on.   Two items I wanted to mention:   1. Tony Hamilton, weather support   Tony Hamilton, a meteorologist Ph.D. hired to support Global Markets, spent  a   few weeks in Houston, in training with Mike Roberts team. He went back to   London 10 days ago and he hit the ground running. He is supporting not only   crude and weather derivatives, but also gas and power, and is inundated with   requests for help.    He is supported by another member of Mike Roberts team, Steve Bennett, on a   temporary assignment (10 days planned originally).    Action recommended.    a. Extension of Steve Bennett temporary assignment for a few more weeks. I   have already authorized extension till the 27th. I shall speak more with  Tani   on Wednesday about it. ?b. ?Hiring another weather person to work with Tony   Hamilton, supporting gas and power across continental Europe.     2. Stinson Gibner   Slava is currently in Houston, learning more about research group here and   building a network of relationships. I have a very high opinion of Salvia -   he is a very bright person, very personable and hard working. I still worry   about the depth and breadth of his experience, his understanding of the   totality of Enron business and the relative ?importance of multiple   activities we have to support. I think it makes sense to have a more   experienced research person coaching him for 18-24 months. I talked to Bryan   Seyfried and Ted Murphy and they expressed similar concerns about the depth   of support they expect.   Action recommended.   I still think it makes sense to bring Stinson Gibner to London for an   extended stay. To manage Slavas expectations, I would call Stinson a Head  of   Research for Europe and Asia. His responsibility would also include   coordination of research and model building for other locations than London   where I see a lot of activity that goes on without regular audits and ?  reviews we have in Houston, and over which we have no control (except for   reacting to requests for assistance). I propose that Stinson come to London   in the next few days to discuss the potential assignment with you.    By the way, Greg Whalley agrees with the idea of a senior research person in   London. He, however, recommended Vasant - stronger work ethics is the main   consideration.

The following are some of the items that we discussed during own phone call:  -  attached is a copy of the introduction of the book.  section 1.2 provides a content overview  -  we are planning to market the book globally, and feel the market size  is around 3000 -  the authors names are Dr Chris Stickland and Dr Les Clewlow   -  Mini bio of authors:  Dr. Les Clewlow and Dr Chris Strickland hold Associate Research Positions at both the School of Finance and Economics, University of Technology, Sydney and the Financial Options Research Centre, University of Warwick, UK.  Together, they have over 20 years combined experience in the financial and energy derivative markets and have published many articles in academic and trade journals.  They are the authors of the book Implementing Derivatives Models (Wiley, 1998) and editors of Exotic Options: The State of the Art (ITP, 1998).  Their forthcoming book Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management is due to be published during the second quarter 2000.  Currently, their interests are concentrated in the energy derivatives area, where they have developed a wide range of pricing tools for electricity options and other energy derivatives.   Could you please provide responses to the following: -  Would it be OK if we use the logo for Enron, the global company? -  What will you need from us before printing?  If you need to review the book jacket or the manuscript, please let us know. -  If Enron needs to review anything, how long will it take for Enron to turn it around? -  We are putting together a leaflet advertising our energy course.  We would like to mention the forthcoming book and that it is being sponsored by Enron...is this OK with you?  No logo will be used. -  We would like to produce a leaflet / brochure advertising the book as well, but this will follow after we have the book cover designed.  Should I work with Andrew at Stokes Account Ex. on this?  -  How do we handle the money side of things?     The manuscript is not fully completed, but we may begin typesetting any day now.  I think it will take about 3-4 weeks to typeset and then another 3 weeks to print and bind.  Sometime in late April? It looks like we will be in Houston around the 7th of March...will you be around either the 7th or 8th?  I hope you are enjoying your time at home.  Let me know if you need anything further.

__label__Save	correlation matrix reduction Zhiyang,  Got your message.    As we discussed, the best way to breakdown the big correlation matrix between  different location indices is through cluster analysis.  The idea is to select major hubs and the satellite markets.  By establish the correlation between the hubs and correlation between the satellites and the hubs, the big matrix can be significantly reduced.    Then the traders only need to input the correlations between the hubs.  This technique has been applied in our Value at Risk system.  You may talk to  Tanya to find out the details.

__label__Save	Preface for book Vince, ? Hope you are well. ? We spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book, and =  you kindly offered that you would provide this.? Is this still  possible?? = We realise that you are extremely busy, so Chris and Les went  ahead and wrote=  something, which is below, and if you want to review, change or  re-write?t= he preface, that would be very appreciated.? Let me know  what your thoughts a= re. ? Thanks, Julie (were getting close) ? ?  Preface  ?  ?  ?  One of our main objectives in  writing Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk=  Management has been to bring  together as many of the various approaches fo= r the pricing and risk management  energy derivatives as possible, to discuss=  in-depth the models, and to show how  they relate to each other.? In this =  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models, price a wid= e  range of energy derivatives, or to build a risk management system which use= s a  consistent modelling framework.? We  believe that for practitioners this=  last point is very important and we continue  to stress in our articles and=  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk  management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using  ad-hoc and inconsiste= nt models for different instruments and markets (see also OTHERS WHO PROPOSE=  CONSISTENT  MODELS?).? However, it is not  our wish to concentrate on one=  particular model or models, at the exclusion of  the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user  (although it will probab= ly be clear from our discussions the model(s) we  prefer).? We therefore try a= nd give  as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of al= l the  models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models=  which  best suit their needs.  ?  In order to meet our objectives the  book is divided into 11 chapters.?  In=  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to  mode= l and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the  book= .? In addition to introducing  the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes=  modelling framework we outline  the numerical techniques of trinomial trees=  and Monte Carlo simulation for  derivative pricing, which are used througho= ut the book.  ?  In Chapter 2 we discuss the  analysis of spot energy prices.? As  well as=  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes  that=  can be used to model the prices.?  We look at the well-know process of Geometric Brownian Motion as well as  mean reversion, stochastic volatility=  and jump processes, discussing each and  showing how they can be simulated=  and their parameters estimated.  ?  Chapter 3, written by Vince  Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of Enron Corp., discusses volatility  estimation in energy commodity markets.?=   This chapter builds on the previous one.? It examines in detail the methods= ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different=   pricing models introduced in chapter 2.?  Examples from crude, gas, and electricity markets are used to illustrate  the technical and interpretativ= e aspects of calculating volatility.  ?  Chapter 4 examines forward curves  in the energy markets.? Although  such=  curves are well understood and straight-forward in the most financial  markets, the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less wel= l  defined curves.? In this chapter we  describe forward price bounds for ener= gy prices and the building of forward  curves from market instruments.? We  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward  curves in energy markets; the arbitrage approach, the econometric=  approach, and  deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochasti= c factors.  ?  Chapter 5 presents an overview of  structures found in the energy derivativ= e markets and discusses their uses.? Examples of products analysed in this =  chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as energy  swaptions, compound options, Asian options, barrier options, lookba= ck options,  and ladder options.  ?  Chapter 6 investigates single and  multi-factor models of the energy spot=  price and the pricing of some standard  energy derivatives.? Closed form =  solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option prices  both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the=  models in  this chapter including a three factor, stochastic convenience yield and interest  rate model.  ?  Chapter 7 shows how the prices of  path dependent and American style option= s can be evaluated for the models in  Chapter 6.? Simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a variety  of path dependent options.? In order  to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial  tree scheme is developed.? This tree  is built to be consistent with the observed forward=  curve and can be used to  price exotic as well as standard European and American style options.  ?  Chapter 8 describes a methodology  for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed  forward curve.? The approach results  in a multi-factor model that is able to realistically capture the=  evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves.?  The user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general  form.? Closed-form solutions are  developed for pricing standard European options, and efficie= nt Monte Carlo  schemes are presented for pricing exotic options.? The chapter=  closes with a discussion of  the valuation of American style options.  ?  Chapter 9 focuses on the risk  management of energy derivative positions.? =  In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions =  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem  of managing the risk through time.?  We begin with delta hedging a=  portfolio containing derivatives and look  at extensions to gamma hedging = =01) illustrating the techniques using both spot and  forward curve models.? The=  general  model presented in Chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi-factor hedging of a  portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed.  ?  Chapter 10 examines the key risk  management concept of Value at Risk (VaR)=  applied to portfolios containing  energy derivative products.? After  discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs  (volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.? We then=  compare the fours major  methodologies for computing VaR; Delta, Delta-gamm= a, historical simulation and  Monte-Carlo simulation, applying each to the sam= e portfolio of energy  options.? In this chapter we also  look at testing the=  VaR estimates for various underlying energy market  variables.  ?  Finally, in Chapter 11 we review  modelling approaches to credit risk.?  We=  look in detail at two quite different approaches, CreditMetrics (J. P. Morg= an (1997)) and  CreditRisk+ (Credit Suisse Financial  Products (1997)) for whi= ch detailed information is publicly available.? Together these provide an extensive set  of tools with which to measure credit risk.? We present numerical examples of  applying these techniques to energy derivatives.  ? Before  we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this=  book are tools  which should be used with the benefit of an understanding o= f how both the =01+tool=01,  and the market works.? The  techniques we descri= be are certainly not =01&magic wands=018 which can be waved at  data and risk mana= gement problems to provide instant and perfect solutions.? To quote from the RiskMetrics Technical  Document =01&=01( no amount of sophisticated analyti= cs will replace experience and  professional judgement in managing risk.=018.?  How= ever, the right tools, correctly used make the job a lot  easier!

Identifying the best research problems in terms of 1) highest innovation potential and 2) highest projected impact would be at the top of my list. It might be unprofessional on my side to talk to an audience that I dont have any prior information about and is very diverse anyway; it could actually be dangerous. I would feel MUCH more comfortable to do that in my second visit, after I have understood the  environment better and I have some results to talk about. I would like to be in a position to impress people when I give my first talk at Enron. (Besides, I will have to prepare good slides for such a talk and I am totally swamped all next week.)  > 3.

The process for starting summer work is going well, and there will be no problem we start work on May 30. I got a place to live, and reserved a flight. Im going to leave for Houston on May 29 (expected time to arrival is around noon) I am very much excited to have opportunity to join the project making an exchange platform.  I think its time Id better remind you of scheduling a meeting with me, sometime on May 30.  I hope you let me know what to to after I arrive at Houston. And please let me know if you have anything you think I prepare, to get better outcome from the summer work. If you give me a brief on the work, it would be a great help for me to decide which material I should carry from here to Houston.

In addition, Global Energy Business and Electric Light & Power are interested in running the paper, but only one will at the end feature it because both target the same audience.  However, your friend Ann Ku currently is working on a story on weather derivatives in general for Global Energy Business and she proposed to feature Enrons power demand swaps as part of the article if you would be willing (and your schedule permits) to create another example including quotes and graph (different from the one used in the paper) on how this tool works, for instance, for a golf club, manufacturer, etc.  This way, we would receive coverage in Global Energy Business and could pitch the story to Electric Light & Power.

__label__Save	RE: EOL Pricing Algorithm Hi Bob,  some comments : 1.  You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.  I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights. 2.  You request bid-mid-ask prices for each trade --- given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order (especially for limit orders), would you need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over this time interval (time of order to time of execution)?  Also, for failed trades, you may need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection.  This again mainly applies to limit orders, as the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed of execution (something to check).   -----Original Message----- From:  Lee, Bob   Sent: Monday, April 23, 2001 8:33 AM To: Kaminski, Vince; Shanbhogue, Vasant; Barkley, Tom Cc: Lu, Zimin; Huang, Alex; Gibner, Stinson Subject: EOL Pricing Algorithm  A draft data request for EOL data we would use to study P&L patterns for the George pricing algorithm is attached for your review.

So here is an outline of the R&R and required technology to support the administration of factor loadings:     << File: FactorLoadingProcess.doc >>   Broadly, I have assumed that Global Risk Ops can run the process. However, exceptions can take one of two forms:  Large jumps in VaR due to bona fide changes in correlations; Pathologies in the matrix construct supporting factors;  For either, tools are required for users to examine the exceptions and make changes as necessary (generally Global ops in the former case and RAC/Research in the latter).  Note that the IT Development group has no part in this business process beyond building the tools.  Lets use this as the starting point to develop a business model that makes this work.

__label__DontSave	Rice Energy Club Roundtable topics Dear John, dear Vincent,   Let me up-date you on the roundtables we decided in the last meeting to focus on during the rest of the academic year.  The original idea was to keep the number of events from 3 to 4 roundtables each semester.  The result of the last meeting with all members was driven by enthusiasm, and as you see below we produced a prolific list of 13 subjects.  Maybe you can help us to narrow down to a reasonable number, 12 events (one we had yesterday) by May 2002 we think are too many.    I also would take this opportunity to update on the ongoing relationships with the most prominent industry in the sectors and have your feedback, suggestion on how to group them in the roundtable. We got great support so far from Reliant, Enron, Mirant, Schell (Coral), Bp, Duke.   El Paso, Chevron-Texaco, Phillips, and Halliburton etc.. also are interested and we will present the club to them as well.  The major challenge for us is not transform the Energy Club in a Finance Energy Club.  At Rice we already have a Finance club and it works very well.  We want first educate about the energy industry in general, and second present the opportunities for MBAs in the industry in different areas, including finance but not limited to.   Topics of Roundtable Meetings:   0) Energy 101  1) Corporate Finance (Treasurer or Controller) 2) Energy Consulting 3) Financial Services (trading, risk management) 4) Origination, Marketing and Sales (Oil, Gas, Electricity) - Marteen 5) Project Development, strategic planning 6) Project Finance 7) Project Risk Management 8) Regulation, Deregulation, and Restructuring - Reliant done 9/17/2001 9) Structuring of Products 10) Supply Chain 11) Telecom - Broadband 12) Venture Capital within energy industry - Brian, Paresh   Thanks in advance for your precious suggestions and I am looking forward to meeting you.

Mars is a private company, considered to be the largest privately owned manufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing  its finances, so the best I could do is refer to Forbes estimate of $15 Billion annual revenue and to the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in the business of manufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R)) food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and other products.  Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that emphasizes the long term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-win solutions with its suppliers, customers and partners.  As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of its expenses goes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history of researching those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand (people eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).  CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been very successful, with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage in these arenas. CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports  the purchasing function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is a multidiscipline and multinational team with a lot to offer.  Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile based on manufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in  this area. Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to talk to.  In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing to anything at this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to pursue the opportunity we discussed in the future.  I am looking forward to our video conference call.  Kind regards,  Avi    --------------------------------------- Avi I.

A higher bid was submitted prior to  Wednesdays 1 p.m. MST      deadline in a four-day open season, a pipeline spokesman said. However,  the original      negotiating party has until this afternoon to match the new price and  retain the capacity.        The new bid was for $38 million over one year starting Jan. 1, about $8  million more than      the amount in Fridays announcement ($30 million). One source called it  ridiculous that      someone was willing to pay so much for the space, given that on a  mark-to-market basis      the capacity is worth only about $20-25 million.        Late last week some sources speculated that Duke Energy was the  recipient of next      years package given its large power generation holdings in California.  A marketer      yesterday said he believed Dynegy upped the ante. Rather than go  through all the      hassles they [Dynegy] had at FERC with the 1998-99 package, they let  someone else do      all the work this time and then came in late with a higher bid. That way  no one can      complain that the procedure was tainted. After all, Dynegy has quite a  few power plants      in California to keep fueled, and all of their current FT on El Paso  expires at the end of      this year. Of course, they still could be thwarted if the original  negotiated customer      matches their bid. It may all sound kind of Machiavellian but sort of  makes sense. Other      sources heavily discounted the chances of Dynegy being the new high  bidder, pointing out      that the company made significantly less than expected this year because  San      Juan/border basis differentials narrowed significantly. A Dynegy source  indicated that the      company was involved in the bidding and lost to Duke in the first round.        Regardless of what happens next year, a marketer noted that the Southern  California      border/San Juan basis spread continues to compress as SoCal Gas  withdraws from      storage and east-of-California utilities exercise their peaking  contracts because of cold      weather in the Rockies and elsewhere in the West. From a December index  spread of 29      cents, the border/basin gap was down to about 18 cents Wednesday, she  said.

__label__DontSave	Re: smoothing methodology for extracting forward forward volatilities Following up on our discussions I implemented one method for creating forward  forward curve from implied vol curve.  I sorted out 12 forward curves from an original forward vol curve, each of 12  curves corresponding to certain month. Then I fitted each of 12 curves with a function:  y=a+A/power(x+b, beta)  I figured out that when beta is from (0, .5) the above function is suitable  for performing our bootstrapping routine of deriving ff vols from implied, because:  y(x+t) * y(x+t) * (x+t) - y(x) * y(x) * tx> 0                  for all x, t.  (I have to double check on this again. Also when beta>0.5 there are some  combinations of parameters a, A, b, beta for which above equality holds). Even with restriction on beta this class of  functions represents quite a variety of shapes.  Below you see the example of fitting as well as the example of ff vol curve  constructed from implied vol curve for NG.  Ill try this for power as well.  Any comments?

They already figured that we must be interested in  modelling Dabhol. 2.  The WTI EOL trading simulation had an error.   We were counting a  mid-offer spread profit on each trade, but we actually would make the spread  on each round-trip transaction (one trade to open, one trade to close).    I  modified the calculation and sent the new numbers to Greg Whalley (he is the  one who caught the mistake, so there goes my bonus for the year.) and John  Lavorato.

As it turns out, Christian left RAC in April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that theyd only been around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.     From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

Fast REP is a powerful graphical method to compare risk management policies. It focuses on extreme potential losses and potential pain points. While having some similar characteristics with the VAR (Value at Risk) framework and the Nobel-prize winning Markowitz model of variance minimization for a prescribed mean rate of return, it shifts the focus from an investment orientation to a risk management perspective extremely appropriate for a variety of industries, such as energy or telecom.   This methodology has been created by Stanford University Prof Sam Chiu and myself, and is now being applied as consulting services by Oncept. Attached is a copy of an unpublished article on the subject. We will adapt it or modify it to fit your editorial constraints, should you be interested.

__label__DontSave	RiskNews Update - 25/01/2002 Dear Subscriber,  Welcome to RiskNews Update - 25/1/2002  The focus of investigations into the collapse of Enron turned to its derivatives trading business this week. Expert testimony in a US Senate hearing Thursday by Frank Partnoy, a professor in the University of San Diego School of Law, warned that profits the firm attributed to its derivatives operations may have been inflated due to systematic problems with the way Enron valued its positions and recorded them in its trading book. But Partnoy - who is currently researching a book about Enrons fall - failed to provide any hard evidence. Enron spokesman Vance Meyer refused to address the matter, stating Enron would not offer counterarguments to each testimony. To vote on whether derivatives played a key role in Enrons demise, visit http://www.risknews.net.  Meanwhile, Citibank and Soci?t? G?n?rale will sell warrants for the first time in the North American retail market on Monday, via the Bourse de Montr?al. The expansion is significant for the banks, both of which are market leaders in the warrants business, as it could open the way to selling the products to the US retail market. A tight US regulatory environment currently impedes the selling of warrants in the US.  Operational risk software and data vendors Raft International and OpVantage plan to integrate their respective op risk applications, Raft Radar and OpVar. US-based OpVantage was established in April last year when PricewaterhouseCoopers and NetRisk merged their op risk offerings. The firms believe the joint offering should allow users to manage their entire operational risk process from developing and collecting risk indicators through to calculating capital-at-risk.  On the people front, Lehman Brothers lured a 15-person equity barrier options team from rival CSFB. The move is the largest hiring spree in Lehmans two-year drive to boost its equity derivatives capability. The team will be led by Jerry Guthrie. Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, hired Michel Iskander to head its OTC derivatives structuring business.

__label__DontSave	FW: Vince, I want you to be aware of the discussions between RAC, IT and Research regarding using more than 7 factors for VAR.  I presented this idea couple of months ago. This will resolve the issue of capturing term-structure of correlations across different commodities which we have for our current VAR system and which we try to overcome by some patches (joint factors for selected groups of commodities). This will not increase the amount of calculations. In fact, just the opposite, this will decrease the number of independent random variables which drive the model from approximately 1000 to about 60-40.  RAC did not pay much attention at that time. IT was busy with other things. This task was low priority.  Recently Naveen realized that his Convolution VAR will not work unless this idea of increasing the number of factors  is implemented. With the present system he needs to deal with 1000 independent random variables and this is not feasible for Convolution (or Analytical) VAR.   We had a meeting regarding this issue last week and the consensus was finally to go ahead and increase the number of factors. This is good news because we need this change in our system for the new Reliability VAR as well.  What worries me that Naveen presents this change now as part of the Convolution VAR. Not only it sounds now like his idea, but, more importantly, I am afraid that when we need the same change (60 factors) for Reliability VAR we will have to seek IT support again and compete with RAC for resources and we always loose in this battle. In addition, the  Monte-Carlo is not going away so the right thing to do is to implement 60 factors in our production system.

These changes include Factor Loadings and correlations:  The factor analysis will be done jointly, with more factors in the Convolution framework.

Frank    -----Original Message----- From:  Jia, Winston   Sent: Monday, July 23, 2001 9:31 AM To: Tamarchenko, Tanya; Hayden, Frank Cc: Andrews, Naveen; Basu, Nilay; Yu, Jin Subject: RE:    Tanya and Frank,  The method will be first implemented for Convolution VaR.  To implement the method for current VaR (Monte Carlo method) needs many changes to existing programs, hence it will take longer.  The methodology is simple, but there are still some issues need to be confirmed/resolved, mostly related to data.  1. Data Alignment:  I understand that we will use fixed contract methodology from now on. We still need expiration rules to find prompt month for each primary curves.  Hence we still need make sure all expiration rules are set up correctly for each primary curve.  2. Data missing:  How do we handle data missing problem.  What should we do if there are some missing prices for some curves.  Do we recreate those missing data or do we eliminate all the prices on those missing dates?  If we recreate, then how.  If we eliminate, then we may eliminating many good data because a few bad curves.  3. What will be the implication if we mix weekly curves with monthly curves together.  It seems OK, but we need make sure this is the case.  4. Do we still need factor look up for those inactive curves?  Or we dont care since we are using their true history.  There may be some other issues coming up when get into the design.

__label__DontSave	Organizational Announcement As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.  Organizational Matters The Creditors Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.  From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.  By now, you must have heard of NETCO. This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enrons most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.  As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.  Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.  Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditors Committee.  Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.  Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enrons various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enrons reorganization plan and value preservation.  Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enrons reorganization plan.  Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:  Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman  Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.  We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyones patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

__label__Save	natural gas production Vince-  I spoke with Roy Kass of the Energy Information Agency this morning. Apart  from clarifying the timeliness, or lack thereof, of the published  state-specific wellhead production estimates, he indicates their scientists  find severe weather in the fields (freezes, hurricanes) to be a far more  significant issue in production, and in wellhead prices, than is severe  weather in the Northeast, for instance. Also, he agrees with you as to there  being strictly increasing marginal costs in production, there being a rich  texture of wells in terms of their efficiency, technologies, maintenance and  investment issues.

__label__Save	Steve Leppard Hi Vince,  HR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a  noticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to  pay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with  a potential gap - particularly in light of what were seeing in our quant  recruiting effort for credit trading and research.  Id like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and  keep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:  1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  Im not  sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token  salary increase.  2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for  making Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to  EBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy  and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at  year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater  responsibility.  3)  We have some people that were trying to get under long-term (3-yr)  contract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of  these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.   Weve not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer  to keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually  binding him to the job.  Id value your thoughts on this.  Thanks,  Dale Dale Surbey dale.surbey@enron.com enron.com Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com

I review the quantitative issues  arising from Enron Europe models. I am in this function given my background (PhD from Imperial College-London)  and also due to my past experience as risk manager for a brazilian investment bank and Louis Dreyfus.  My agenda includes the review of a number of deals (Wessex, TPL, Eastern,  ...), as well as the  review of the construction of european gas and power price curves and their  respective volatility curves. Currently I am devoting most of my time to the analysis of the UK gas market,  its respective price curve and term structure of volatility.  Bjorn and David suggested it could be very productive if I had the chance to  meet you and your team to discuss issues related to modelling prices and risk measurement tools.   I will be in Houston from the 10th to 15th September. I wonder if you could  book some time for me in your agenda and also ask some members of your team to do the same.

With so many options on the market, it can be difficult for customers and ASPs to pick the right kinds of security for storage and transmission of sensitive corporate information.  Perhaps the ideal security product for ASPs is one that gives customers the most comfort, is reasonably cost-effective, and can be managed by a staff that may not be expert in security.  The toughest part for ASPs is that their customers hold them to a security double standard. These customers often expect better security for their remotely hosted systems and data than they provide for their local systems.  I find this ironic, considering most security infractions occur from inside an organization, not outside. Conventional wisdom places the percentage of breaches at 80% internal, and 20% external (though I havent independently verified these statistics).  Based on that information, I would think customers considering an ASP model for applications and data would be stumbling over one another to locate their systems at an ASP, thus reducing their exposure to system compromises.  Instead, prospective customers typically hit the ASP with security questions that may not be outside the expertise of the ASP in question and may be only marginally understood by the customers themselves. ASP business development staff have to become versed in the technology workings of VPNs for data transfer and public-key infrastructure for authentication and encryption, for example, just so they can get in the door with a potential customer.  Unfortunately, comprehensive security procedures and technologies are typically very expensive to implement and require a level of security expertise that most ASPs cannot hope to implement and maintain. And Im not so sure these technology answers are really solving the problem of security for ASPs and their customers. Again, 80% of security breaches come from the inside. In a lot of cases, that means that the true threat is from people who are already inside the security demilitarized zones. It seems to me that security technology is really only part of the answer to the overall security question.  In my opinion, ASPs and large enterprises should look beyond the latest security technology and hire security experts from the Department of Defense, NSA or the CIA who can help implement security policies and procedures that will be effective in eliminating the 80% internal breaches.  There are several documented systems, publicly available from the government, that outline the policies and procedures necessary to meet certain levels of security. For example, there is a series of trusted systems books available from INFOSEC, each named after a color: the Teal Book, the Orange Book, and the Bright Blue Book, all of which are great resources for a variety of security topics.  No doubt, there are some commercial enterprises that also adhere to recognized security standards and can provide the procedures and technology necessary to ensure the integrity of critical business information inside and outside corporate networks. Partnerships between ASPs and these emerging companies would make a lot of sense.  I dont mean to exclude technology solutions from this discussion. I believe that there are significant strides being made to make security technology more usable and affordable. But I fear that ASPs are setting up service-level agreements with their customers that guarantee certain levels of security and intrusion detection, but are really only covering the most visible problem.

__label__Save	GPCM Summary 1999 This has been a great year for RBAC and GPCM. During the year we have doubled to 10 the number of GPCM licensees. This means weve also doubled the number of wonderful people weve trained and are supporting. And, I sincerely mean it when I say it has been a real pleasure working with you all. One of the things we stress when we are selling GPCM is that it takes a strong commitment on the part of the licensee, a commitment to find skilled and dedicated people to make optimal use of this sophisticated tool.  And, Im happy to report that we have that quality in the GPCM teams we work with. Next year we have some big challenges.  We will be converting the system from Office 97 to Office 2000 and will also need to make sure it will run in the Windows 2000 environment. We will be adding new flexibility in defining our transportation zone price curves to enable users, especially pipeline users, to test variations of pricing strategies for their impacts on basis and utilization. We will be adding a capability for modeling future FT contracting. We will upgrade our existing Database Comparison program to allow you to select those items you want to have automatically updated in your own databases. We will continue to work with RDI to improve pipeline and storage infrastructure representations, to provide interfaces between GASdat and GPCM, and to give you regular optional updates for your own databases. We are beginning to plan out a new website dedicated to GPCM licensees (and possibly prospects).  We have acquired gpcm.rbac.com and gpcm.net for this purpose. In making these various changes, we look also to you, our existing licensees, for enhancement and improvement ideas.  We are planning to conduct interviews of our licensees during the next 30 - 60 days to find out what you like, but also what you would like to see improved, as well as some new ideas for GPCM.  I would like to thank the following people for their contributions to GPCM during 1999.  o Liam Leahy for his excellent marketing, sales, and planning support o Charles Carr for his quality work on our website and support with subtle Visual Basic programming issues o Richard Berman for thorough research on design tools and skilled Windows programming o Richard McBride for continuing support and development of his EMNET optimization program o Aaron and James Brooks for design and production of the PowerPoint pipeline maps now available in GPCM o Mike Farina and RDI for their continuing improvement of the GPCM data and GASdat database o GPCM users who have found data bugs and reported them to use so that we could get them corrected o GPCM users who have suggested new features which would make GPCM a better product o GPCM users who have given us sales leads during the year o GPCM users who have used GPCM to help their companies make better plans and decisions, which is, after all, the purpose for which it was designed  We hope all of you have a wonderful holiday season and look forward to an even better year 2000.

__label__Save	enrons new weather system, courtesy the research dept. V  Last night, I tested our new system for real-time surveillance and messaging  of the weather, and it delivers the data to desktops throughout the building  more than 6 1/2 minutes before the National Weather Service updates their  webpages. Our current technology was web-scraping these pages via ftp, then  parsing into a database. The impact of these 6 1/2 minutes for the hourly  power traders is enormous- the weather stations upload their data around 53  minutes after the hour, and we can now receive them within 2 minutes later.  We can now re-estimate our nonlinear stack model before the top of the hour,  when hourly power trading begins. Otherwise, we would not have model results  until around 15 minutes after the hour. Notably, hourly power trading is, for  all intents and purposes, concluded by then (they trade for 10-15 minutes and  manage the scheduling for the next 30 or so miutes). So, effectively, we may  now be one *hour* ahead of where we were just a few days ago, in terms of  information. People are very excited up here, from the CTO on down- thanks  for letting it happen.

__label__Save	Market Maker simulation V.2 Stinson and Vince,  I finished the second version of the model which deals with Open to Close  trading. The major difference is that there is an additional mark to market at Open  price which will affect the P/L.  I also added the output features that John wants to see.  The cumulative P/L is path dependent, the Net Open Allowed seemingly has a strong influence on the cumulative P/L trajectory.  (the anomaly I  discussed  with Vince is due to the trajectory shape change which needs further  examination).  Could you review what I have done before we talk to John again ?

__label__Save	California Update 1/31/01 Please do not hesitate to contact Robert Johnston (x39934) or Kristin Walsh  (x39510) with additional questions.  Executive Summary An announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of  long-term contracts (price and term). The threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as Davis hatches a plan  to 1) pass on court ordered rate increases and 2) issue revenue bonds. Audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred  to parent companies.  Davis is expected to use the threat of endless  appeals in courts and a possible ballot initiative in November to keep the  pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt, as well  as to limit the scope of the rate hikes. Davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him  with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to California  consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy. Davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups.  If there is a  ballot initiative in November to challenge the expected court-ordered rate  hikes, it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state.  Legislation and Bail Out Bill AB1X was heard for several hours in the Senate Appropriations  yesterday.  Issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure,  specifically for communities that have harsh climates.  However, the bill has  received support from almost everyone including consumer groups.   The bill  is expected to pass sometime today.  Tim Gage, CA Director of Finance said  Davis supports all the provisions in AB1X and expected to sign.    Bill AB18X was not heard in the Assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear  today.  In committee hearings Monday, the DWR testified it is spent all of  the $400M and were spending $45M/day in the spot market to buy power.  According to sources with direct access to Governor Davis, the on-going court  battle, as discussed below, is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a  settlement.  Davis recognizes that 1) the expected court ruling in the CPUC  case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to  California rate payers; 2) despite that ruling, the state government has the  ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the  two utilities unless they come to terms.  Thus, Davis believes that  California consumers cannot avoid getting  hit with higher electricity  charges, but he plans to use the threat of an appeal (and a possible ballot  initiative) to limit the amount of the rate hikes.    A plan to exempt the lowest income, smallest consumers from any rate increase  and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130% of a baseline  usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in Sacramento.  That would  still hit about one half of all consumers (since the baseline is set at 60%  of average consumption), but it is progressive in a politically important  sense.   Making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night  when PG&E admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many  customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates.    The companys defense (they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash) was  met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation  policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious  efforts by Californians to use less electricity.   Every time you think  theres a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves,  something like this happens, one legislator moaned.  Long-Term Contracts  A second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the  negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long-term power buying  contracts Davis initiated earlier this month.  The first wave of those  contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be  surprisingly positive, according to officials in the talks.  We got a series  of good offers in those initial proposals.   And some not so good ones, one  official told our source.   The idea is to announce the results of the first  contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say,  you want in on this with these terms?   We think well eventually shake  loose a lot of supply with this strategy.  Bankruptcy  Because of these new dynamics, there is improved market confidence that  California will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for  SoCal Edison and PG&E, even as they are set to miss another round of payments  to creditors and suppliers today (remember, there is a standstill agreement  among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until Feb. 13).  We believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost  by the court case in front of US District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew in Los  Angeles, which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for  elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week, at  the latest.  In fact, without that political cover it would be impossible to  square all the various circles of this crisis.   Audit Results and Ballot Initiatives Markets, Bush administration officials, and perhaps utility companies  themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will  launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200l to bring all  electricity generation back under state control.  The threat of a proposition  initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the  California Public Utilities Commission released in the last 48 hours  confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since  mid-January.  First, the audit of SoCal Edison confirmed that $2 billion of  the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to  itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells  power.  Second, it confirmed that Edison electric paid nearly $5 billion in  profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its  stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even  while it was going on a debt-issuing binge.   The audit of PG&E released late last night was even more damaging: PG&E  management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to  clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis by not making deep  spending cuts, including scaling back management salaries.  The auditors  also questioned the utilitys decision to funnel some $4.7 billion of its  profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company,  which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks.   Basically, they took the money and ran, as State Senate Speaker Burton put  it yesterday.  What appears to be Governor Gray Davis grudging acceptance of reality is  actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough  rate hikes/taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without  triggering a new -- and far more damaging -- burst of populist outrage among  a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making  this all up.  There is no doubt that this use of money by SoCal Edison and  the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the  spirit of the 1996 deregulation law, but that is irrelevant in popular  political terms.  Were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by  the court case discussed below, these audits would make settlement extremely  difficult.  Keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key  to understanding the very complex game that Davis, his advisers and senior  legislators are now playing.   A ballot initiative would be a potential  disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re-establishing full  public control over the electric utilities.  Even if the state and utilities  successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before  that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during  that prolonged period.   Thats something California cannot afford as  businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate.   Court Battle Thus, legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of  the court case in Los Angeles that SoCal Edison and PG&E are likely to win in  mid-February.  The court will most likely grant the two utilities $12.7  billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders  of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30%, California politicians  could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start  of this extended drama: political cover. Davis will then have to rely on his  political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the  utilities to pass on something less than the full $12.7 billion debt.  PG&E and SoCal Edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed  to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they  have accumulated since August last year when the PUC refused to let them  raise prices even as electricity prices soared.  The court said the 1996  deregulation law was crystal clear -- when the two utilities had repaid  so-called stranded costs, they were free to begin charging whatever they  needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power.   Although the utilities won this case, the Judge stayed his order until  February 14th at the state governments request.  As that deadline  approaches, an intense new negotiating round is under way.  On the one hand,  political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher  electric prices (the courts made me do it), but on the other hand, they  also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would  force electricity rates up by about 40% on top of natural gas bills that have  soared by about 300% since last year.  Utility companies are playing this  card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final  bailout.  Well just wait until the court puts the order into effect in  mid-February then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and  easily.  One tactic the state political officials are using, in order to force a  settlement, is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the  next couple of years.  One political official pointed out that they could  keep the utilities from receiving their money this year, next year or perhaps  even the year after. Sure, we tell them, they will probably win in court and  get that money.  Eventually.  We are making them well aware that unless we  have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the Supreme  Court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least.  We dont think  the creditors will be quite that patient.

__label__Save	Re: digitals Pavel, Many thanks for your note.  I understand that Digitals are not core Enron business but as you know, Im  trying to explore Digitals to give, for example, a company a guaranteed  income in year one (to mop up expiring tax losses). This  is offset by a  guaranteed expense in year two. See attached hypothetical example. The  digital will reflect an underlying commodity to which a company is exposed to  and would be part of a price risk management strategy, thereby giving it  commercial purpose.   I would be interested in hearing from you generally on the subject --  the  rational for using Digitals and  your knowledge of its use in other markets  (electricity or other commoodity or in the banking sector).  It seems to me that setting the srike is key and a value judgement or am I  wrong, and are there curves and models which could help you substantiate  this? In any event, do you have a feel for what an acceptable % of chance or  likelihood that a commodity price hits the strike on a digital before it  becomes non arms length and does not pass the smell test?  Vince, Jarek suggested that you may be able to assist. Your views would also  be appreciated.  Gillian.      From: Pavel Zadorozhny on 02/11/2000 15:15 CST To: Gillian Lockwood/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: digitals  Digital options are extremely uncommon in the crude oil market. Nobody ever  asked me to show quotes in the OTC market. The only time we encountered them  was when producers, brought by our marketing team, wanted to sell a  knock-outable swap, whereby they would get a higher swap price in exchange  for cancelling the swap if the price settled below a certain level. This  structure had a digital put embedded in it, although the customers didnt  necessarilly know that. The companies were US oil and gas producers: Venoco,  Titan, Magnum Hunter, Patiena Oil & Gas, Belco, Central Resources. It was  about 1 year ago. In the OTC market, at about the same time, I asked for  quotes to hedge these transactions and sold a digital Cal 00 $16 swaption to  Elf and strips of digital puts to somebody else that I cannot recall.

The issue is a=  sort of combo issue merging all of our publications (The Desk, The Risk De= sk, New Power Exec and The Bandwidth Desk), and takes a look at trends, rev= iew of the year in about 20 categories (tech, policy, VC stuff, market tren= ds, credit, strategies, risk, book reviews, weather) and of course a look a= head. Most of the submitted pieces we run are in the form of commentaries o= n specific topics -- were trying to stay away from the usual broad, mushy = stuff you read about this time of the year -- translation, were looking fo= r a detailed view of things -- open with a short take on key bits that occu= rred this year, how it may have altered the course of the market or a parti= cular sector (why or why not with details) and finally whats ahead. The ge= neral formula works well weve found; we expect the issue to be at least 40=  pages this year. Im sure you remember the drill from last year. Anyhow, b= ack to you. What Im looking for is this -- the fall of the Big E has certa= inly put more focus on better risk management -- great, but what does that = really mean?

Dear Vince Kaminski  Thank you so much for the kind invitation for the meeting.  I have been always inspired by and having respect for the recent revolutionary achievements of Enron in the energy markets My former employer McKinsey Tokyo in fact featured your company*s success in the last Quarterly, and it clearly states (in Japanese though) that the quantitative research capability at Enron is now at the world*s top level, which has been always behind the scene.  I am extremely honored to receive the email from you and in fact interested in knowing the opportunity of working in the energy field; However, very unfortunately I will have to come back to Japan, or at least to the East Asian region,  upon graduation due to an inevitable family reason. My wife*s father passed away recently and an old mother-in-law is now left alone without relatives. I understand that Enron has not yet embarked on the next big project of freeing the outdated Japanese energy market, (which by the way I strongly hope ) so I may not have a very good chance of making contribution at your company right now.  Lastly, if you need a staff in Tokyo in some future who understands  both the risk management analytics at the F622 level and the local language and business custome better than average, please contact me any time.  I will be happy to assist as much as possible.

Skilling <sreinar@enron.com> cc: Vince J Kaminski <vkamins@ect.enron.com>, Robert A. Jarrow  <raj15@cornell.edu>, Robert C. Merton <rmerton@hbs.edu>   Subject:    Mr. Jeffrey K. Skilling President and C.O.O., Enron Corp.  Dear Jeff,  This email is from Robert Jarrow (Cornell) and myself (Joe Cherian). I hope you recall meeting/lunching with Bob Jarrow & me when you keynoted at my 1999 Math Finance Day conference here at Boston University. I wanted to introduce you to SKG Inc., a startup that is focused on providing an innovative service to the electronic trading community. Messers Kuppuswamy Seshadhri, Sriketan Mahanti, and Gaurav Mallik are the principal founders of SKG, Inc. Bob Jarrow and I represent the companys Scientific Advisory Board. Nobel laureate Robert Merton, who also sat on our table during your keynote address, very kindly serves as an ad hoc Senior Advisor to SKG and has been an invaluable resource to SKG, including putting us in touch with JP Morgan. Coincidentally, the C.O.O. of JP Morgan Capital Corp. Ed Colloton, in an April 7 meeting told us he would introduce us to the C.F.O. of Enron Online, whom he knows and at which he felt SKG would have huge value-adding opportunities. However, given Eds busy travel schedule, I dont believe he has been able to do that yet. Hence this joint decision by Bob Jarrow and myself to send you this email.  SKGs solution is to provide dynamic pricing and value maximization in electronic trading of securities/commodities on ECNs and ATSs (Alternative Trading Systems). It achieves this through a process of strategic negotiation using automated agents (intelligent software manifestations). Our system should not be viewed as an ECN, but rather as an enhancement to any extant trading system, be it an ECN, ATS, CLOB, NASDAQ, etc. Our initial system design has been conducted for financial instruments trading, e.g. bonds/equities, but our strategy is as much applicable to energy/power instruments trading, high speed communications bandwidth trading, and other web-based commodities trading, which we believe is of interest to Enron Online.  SKG is superior to existing solutions in the following way: 1)  It considers multiple attributes, e.g., price, time, volatility, bandwidth. (In high speed communication bandwidth scenarios, for example, the dimensions could be price, bandwidth size, time for which bandwidth available, continguity of the allocation, and such.) 2) It involves dynamic matching as opposed to static matching. 3) It is multi-lateral. 4)  It adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions. 5) It allows traders to make important trade-offs, as they do in traditional markets.  Currently, SKG is involved in discussions with the Heads of Trading at Fidelity, Putnam Investments, Lehman Bros., KPMG, Meridien Research, Salomon Smith Barney, JP Morgan, State Street, Banc of America, McKinsey, Citizens Power, and a host of other folks.  We think we have a value-adding service to provide to Enron Online or any other Enron subsidiary that the SKG offering matches and that you deem fit. SKGs founders and I will be very happy to provide you or your representative(s) with more details, including a demo of the prototype, in a meeting. We are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange something appropriate.  Thanks very much, Jeff! We look forward to hearing from you.  With warm regards, Joseph Cherian and Robert Jarrow  Cc: Professor Robert C. Merton  Joseph A.

__label__Save	Comments Julie,  Sorry for the delay. Here are he comments.  Vince  ************************************  Sorry for long delay in responding. I have a few comments. Most are focused on the third article as here is till time to make modifications.  1.  In the second article, I would mention that the formulation of the mean reversion process represents one of several possible equations that capture the same type of market evolution of prices over time. 2.  One comment that applies to both articles. The problem is how one defines the time series of energy prices. The numbers used for Australian NSW pool prices seem to correspond to chronological prices. One alternative approach is to build different time series for the corresponding time intervals for each day. This would result in different price behavior and estimates of jump. The choice is one of convenience and depends on actual problem under investigation. One could argue that volumes of electricity traded during different time slots represent different economic commodities. Figure 3a (Jump Frequency) has units on the vertical axis that require explanation. Are we talking about an expected number of jumps in the total number of half hourly periods in a year? The same goes for f in Table 2 (article number 3).    - aus_2_3.doc VKaminski@aol.com vkaminski@aol.com aol.com julie@lacima.co.uk julie@lacima.co.uk les@lacimagroup.com les@lacimagroup.com  vkamins@enron.com vkamins@enron.com  chris@lacima.co.uk chris@lacima.co.uk

__label__Save	Floating LNG Terminal Folks,  As a follow-up to Scott Neals inquiry this morning concerning  portable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no  such capability currently exists. According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this  opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far  as we know, has constructed such a vessel.    I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the  Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they  have not built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel  would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required  operational and  environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.

__label__Save	Re: the research lunch I would be very willing to make a presentation to you.  This coming Thursday  unfortunately, I have a sick day scheduled (babies will do this kind of thing  to you) and will not come into the office.  Would it be more practical to make the presentation to a select group of a  few (possibly) interested individuals?  This might give us more shceduling  flexibility and would also seem more appropriate, knowing that what I have is  a set of suggestions for development and no earth-shuttering, live product.  Please let me know if this accomodates your needs,  Yannis     Joseph Hrgovcic 03/29/2000 09:35 AM To: Yannis Tzamouranis/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: the research lunch   Yannis,   Shirley will know the room in which the lunch is scheduled. Let her know  what audio-visual materials youll need. Keep in mind that the research group  is now about 40 people, some of whom will be watching the presentation on  video from Portland and from London. The best platform would be to get a  PC-video or PC-screen link-up, so that everyone, including people watching  remotely, can see your computers monitor on a big screen.   The itinerary for the lunch is that we meet at 11:30 and eat lunch and trade  news for the first 30-45 minutes, and then at 12:00 or 12:30 at the latest,  we have a presentation. We try to wrap up by 1:00, so that what we discussed  yesterday should make for a very good presentation in pretty much every way.  From my experience, the audio-visual people need at least an hour advance  warning to get the screens linked up. Let me know if you need any help in  getting you and Jenny the things you need.

__label__DontSave	Alliance Info Alert: FERC Meeting/Filings Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:  At its brief meeting yesterday, FERC approved a stripped-down consent agenda,  without discussion, as described below.  Following this summary is an updated  listing of filings at FERC.  In particular, FERC:  (1) Approved, 3-1, with Comm. Hebert dissenting, an extension of the existing  temporary $1,000/MWh bid caps in the ISO-NE energy, automatic generation  control and operating reserve markets through March 31, 2001.  (2) Rejected an aspect of ISO-NEs July 28 CMS/MSS compliance filing, namely  its proposed Installed Capacity (ICAP) deficiency charge, and directed the  ISO to reinstitute the previous, administratively-determined deficiency  charge that the Commission required the ISO to revert to in its June 28  Order; other aspects of the filing will be addressed separately, FERC  indicated.  (3) Accepted in part, and rejected in part, American Transmission Company,  LLC.s (ATC) proposed OATT and rates, with Comm. Massey concurring.  Among  other things, FERC rejected ATCs innovative rate proposal, without prejudice  to ATC submitting a new FPA Section 205 rate filing, based on its finding  that ATCs ROE and other rate proposals amounted to a request for the  innovative rates that we have indicated we would consider in an RTO  context.  ATC sought such rates prior to joining an approved RTO, FERC  specified, distinguishing this case from its September 28 Order authorizing  innovative rate treatment for International Transmission Company.  (4) Accepted for filing TransEnergies two filed compliance reports on its  procedures for reassignment of transmission rights and the results of its  open season, respectively.  (5) Rejected proposed amendments filed by two Southern Energy parties to  their respective Reliability Must Run (RMR) Agreements with CA ISO, after  finding the amendments were inconsistent with the terms of a prior RMR  settlement.  Numerous significant items were stricken, including the Alliance RTO  compliance filing (CAE-27), the Southern petition concerning its RTO plans  (CAE-23), and the Illinois Power-MISO withdrawal docket (CAE-16).                                  == RECENT FERC FILINGS ==  (1)  RTO DEVELOPMENTS  *  TENASKA filed a motion to intervene out of time regarding ALLIANCEs pro  forma generator interconnection procedures and agreement contained in the  proposed ALLIANCE RTO OATT.

Thanks,  Jeff        Enron Energy Services    From:  Richard L Zdunkewicz                           05/03/2001 09:56 AM    To: James L Bouillion/Enron@EnronXGate, Paul Clayton/Enron@EnronXGate, Vince  J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: James Harris/HOU/EES@EES, Jeff Forbis/HOU/EES@EES, Richard B  Jones/HOU/EES@EES, Cheryl Brashier/HOU/EES@EES  Subject: Risk Profile and Liability Mitigation Product  Please find attached a Scope of Services document and a list of projects  which have been implemented with current EES customers.  The Scope of  Services document is designed to show the types of projects, operations and  maintenance, and facilities management services that EESO typically offers to  its customers based on their industry segment.  The projects and services  offered are very similar across segments and customers, but their level of  deployment varies significantly from segment to segment.    Certain segments were grouped together because the EESO offering would  feature similar assets and services. SIC Codes were given for each segment to represent the types of customers  that comprise each segment.  The list of projects represents general categories from which more specific  projects will be tailored to fit the clients needs.  This project list  represents assets that have been approved by the DSM Desk and was queried  from PCCS. The Operations and Maintenance services can be applied to any energy-related  assets and was compiled from term sheets and IAM.  Generally those activities  have been limited to a few industrial outsourcing deals including Springs,  Polaroid and recently Eli Lilly. Facilities Management is usually outsourced via IPT or through the adoption  of existing vendor contracts and can involve repair and maintenance for all  assets.   Generally this type of activity has been focused on the retail/real  estate segment.      Cheryl, pls set up a meeting with Harris, Clayton, Bouillion, Jones and  Kaminski to discuss this and an action plan to develop a liability mitigation  product.  I will re-present the original product concept at the meeting.   Would like to see the meeting take place late next week.  Thanks.

I received the same email last week and the request has been  taken care of.  In fact, he had a very short time line for the request  and  had subsequently used outside forecasts for the bid.

__label__DontSave	Joint Pain?  Get Better Now!                                                   oguhh JOINT HEAL  If you have deteriorating joints of any kind, joint heal will help regenerate that loss.  Joint Heal has chicken collagen in it as well as the famed glucosamine sulfate.  It also has MSM in it along with Chondroitin Sulfate.  One study quoted by chemist Robert Barefoot told of 387 chronic arthritic patients, half in wheelchairs, who were treated with crushed chicken collagen and gelatin.  ALL were improved and all were out of their wheelchairs in six weeks.  These types of stories do not get publicized as do medications which can not work.  As the medications keep the individual in a gradual decline, people need to realize how simple the answer really is.   Joint pain decreases within three days or sooner as regeneration begins. Joint Heal is 37.95 per bottle, 120 tablets. plus $5.95 shipping and handling.  Call 800-395-7379 to order by credit card.  Joint Heal is nothing like the normal joint products found in the Health food stores. Joint Heal was created by an individual whose mother had knotted up hands from arthritis.  He worked years on a formula that finally helped straightened her hands and has been selling it throughout the world for 4 years.  That product is Joint Heal.  Glucosamine sulfate alone can do only a fraction of what the combination found in Joint Heal can do.  Below is the unmatched combination of ingredients found in Joint Heal.  Vitamin C  100mg, MSM (Methyl-Sulfonyl-Methane)  750mg, Chicken Colagen 250gm, Chondroitin Sulfate (from chicken sternal cartilage) Magnesium  200mg, Copper  500mcg, Manganese  5m, Sodium (as glucosamine sulfate)  60mg, Glucosamine Sulfate 750mg,  Boron  750  mcg.

__label__Save	Norway Visit: Research Agenda Dear All,  I would like to make myself available for some meetings at the Oslo office  during my visit on Friday pm, Monday and Tuesday.  I believe Bjarne will be  available on Tuesday, if not Monday, and so would like to arrange the Trading  and Origination meetings for Tuesday (so that he can attend) and maybe go  through the EnergyDesk issues on Monday.  I will also give a presentation,  probably on Monday.  TRADING: OPTIONS & VOLATILITY CURVES It would be useful to meet with the traders along with Bjarnes team to help  us improve our understanding of the valuation/hedging issues encountered in  trading options (both European and Asian).  I hope to discuss the vol curves  and will bring the example of the recent work done for the UK electricity  desk where a monthly volatility curve generator and initial half-hourly  forward volatility curve have been developed.  ORIGINATION: Any issues arising in complex deals (e.g. dry reservoir, user-time contracts)  etc. perhaps with Didrik.  ENERGYDESK.COM To support the on-going effort to ensure the accuracy of the EnergyDesk.com  systems, I hope to help James Stephen nail-down the reasons for some of the  discrepancies between the EnergyDesk.com valuation and the Oslo book (for  this I hope to meet with Trond).  EXOTIC OPTIONS: If everything runs smoothly, I plan to roll-out the new Asian model which  should also help us in improving our electricity volatility curve.  I will be in the Oslo office from Friday afternoon, and available all day  Monday and Tuesday.  I will be staying at the Grand Hotel and probably  contactable on my mobile: 07747 86813.

These recommendations are informed by the fact that I dont feel Anjam has  much to offer his next employer, except what code and data he can remove from  Enron:  HR-type stuff: 1. Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for  him to remain on the floor. 2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know  our positions and curves next.  IT-type stuff: 1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the  group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more  than a day or two. 2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjams h: drive for weekly intervals  over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has  deleted. 3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjams Notes folders, and provide records  of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  Im worried  about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out. 4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from  Anjams c: drives.  There may be useful info here too.

__label__DontSave	Denise Palmer Huggins Interview Seminars/Forums, etc. Sub Group  I met with Denise on December 16th and here is a recap of the discussion relative to our sub group for your information.  Seminars  -Probably no more than 4 per year -Good curriculum makes a significant difference (ie. quality) -Keep at a reasonable cost -Nymex provides seminars which have an audience of 35 to 50 -Denises experience is that people like topics that are practical adding to their skill   base  Forums  - Broader topics than seminars with range of experts - Can range in size from small groups to very large ballroom settings - Marketing makes a big difference in turn out  Conferences  - Generally not as excited about conferences - Shouldnt try one this year - If do one, keep focused on one topic, not multiple tracks - Should be lean and mean, cost effective, 2 days max  Nymex has many contacts and should be able to help on marketing events and perhaps  doing some sponsorship.  Probably should charge for non members for these events but needs to be reasonable.  Small training sessions could be an opportunity.

__label__Save	Re: Generation Earnings Model Michelle, I agree with you that we need to run AT LEAST 500 iterations.  But I did not realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations. Helen and I talked earlier about using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts and run the parts separately on different processors, then aggregate the results. This procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time. Looks like we have to do it this way now.  Buying a more powerful computer helps but  does not solve the problem.   In addition, we might want to re-consider if writing the code in VB is optimal. I was assured at the very beginning that VB runs as fast (if not faster) as C, but some re-assurance from IT group on this issue is helpful.

Last week we ran Calpine using 46 days of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations. The 100 iteration run took 16 hours to run. To run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days. We are concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be increased to at least 500 iterations.   We are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful than the test computer we have been using. Do you have any suggestions as to how we can improve the process?

__label__Save	Re: MEC Mark,  Steves comment has many merits. I think Stinson Gibner and Grant Masson  (physics Ph.D.s) can help to identify academic and industry sources to validate some of the claims.  On the other hand, even if our guests were wrong by a factor of 2 or 3 in  their time estimates, the technology they develop will bring about a technological revolution with enormous  potential payoffs. It make sense to  stay close to them and  to explore potential investment opportunities.

I really enjoyed our discussions, both at the technical level and otherwise.  I promised to send you an e-mail regarding possible dates for a visit to Enron. I delayed it for a week till my schedule was clearer. Lets see if we can get a match with your schedule - mine is rather terrible:  Friday, 21st of April looks good. But April 23rd is Easter Sunday, so that may make it difficult for some people at Enron to be around. Let me know if that is the case. I am willing to visit then, because the week after that I am scheduled to be in Japan and in the previous weeks I am all committed on Fridays.  Friday, 19th of May is the next possibility, but this probably is too far out. The main problem is that I am operating within a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this research. This window closes by the end of April, and it would be important for the student support funds to be in place then, so that I can make hard commitments to students and attract top talent. I am already reviewing files of students who have approached me for PhD advising, and I am in a mode of doing soft commitments to star-level students to get this research and its potential on their radar screen. Top students are highly sought after by advisors and I want to be an early player in this competition.  Does my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up the project and student support at Stanford? If so, doing it before the end of April is important for getting top people. If the visit can happen after we get the ball rolling, then we can schedule it in May. I assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets going. Please let me know what you think.
